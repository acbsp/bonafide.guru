**From author**

In this age of *Kali-youga*, age of hostility, falsehood and hypocrisy,
demonism is gradually gaining power, desiring to enslave the whole
humanity. Demonic entities are penetrating all fields of human
activities: starting with government activities, socio-political,
economical, mass media and also spiritual fields of different religious
confessions. Unfortunately, International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)
also turned out to be under the influence of the
demonic system, which leaders try to retard, freeze and may be stop the
development of the Society (ISKCON).

Presently many people are starting to understand that they happened to
be under the pressure of demonic system. Finding no way out of this
situation, these people turn their mind’s eye and thoughts towards God.
They go to different religious denominations and pray to God for the
salvation. For the lack of spiritual education, residing in illusion
they pray to Lord for their *material* welfare.

Under the guise of religion demons create multiple religious sects, and
under the lable of altruism and charity they in all possible ways tempt
simple hearted people into these sects. Presenting their invented
religions, strained religious dogmas and traditions, they lead people
away from the Absolute truth — Supreme Personality of Godhead.

*|SP| says*: “Real religious principles are enacted by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although fully situated in the mode of
goodness, even the great åñis who occupy the topmost planets cannot
ascertain the real religious principles, nor can the demigods or the
leaders of Siddhaloka, to say nothing of the asuras, ordinary human
beings, Vidyädharas and Cäraëas”. (S.B. 6.3.19). Veritable religion, or
a law consists in that talks God. If we invent the own laws, not
soobrazuyas' with the program of God, we will fail eventually.

(“Dialectical Spiritualism”)

“The entire world is now full of many asuras in the guise of
politicians, **gurus**, **sādhus**, yogīs and incarnations.”

(S.B. 10.3.21. commentary)

This book is not meant for the wide readership. But this book is simply
necessary for those people who sincerely strive to behold their
spiritual nature and God and want to avoid the deceit of different
pseudo gods and gurus. It will help us to see the surrounding world in a
different way, to learn the things which ISKCON leaders were hiding from
us for many years; to see |SP| as he really is, His true
Greatness; to better and more properly understand the philosophy exposed
in his books and truly become spiritually happy people.

In this book we are presenting materials based on the philosophy and
authentic documents signed by |SP| personally. All this
materials are supported by the references from Sastras and many books of
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada. For your convenience we have quoted
from “The final order” book the ISKCON guru’s letters, conversations,
documents and documents left by |SP|, which as a matter of
fact define the way of ISKCON development for the whole period of its
existence. We also bring documents, fragments from the books, letters,
lectures and conversations of |HDGSP|.

We express our gratitude to the devotees who have worked on the creation
of “The final order” book.

**PREFACE**

Let us start from December 1991 when one devotee (called Bhakta das)
joined the Moscow Begovaya temple. After a while the temple authorities
proposed that he should choose for himself a spiritual master. It seemed
strange to him because he had already accepted |SP| as his
spiritual master within his heart and believed that it was sufficient.
Still he had to obey the rules of the place as he was eager to stay in
the society he had learned about from |SP|’s books.

After a while Bhakta das choused Niranjana Swami, he seemed to him
humble and honest devotee at that time. And with the permission of N.S.
he was given a *pranama-mantra* (the prayer). He had been told to chant
*pranama* to him solely. The time passed and he started noticing that
spiritual connection, he used to have to |SP|, began to fade
away. Despite chanting the *pranama* to this guru Maharaja, the
connection to him did not occur, even though Bhakta das put all his
efforts.

So he approached senior devotees asking them: “Why my spiritual
connection to Niranjana Swami does not occur the way I had it with |SP|?” - 
“That is because you are not initiated by him yet. It
shall be restored right after the initiation.” they said to him. But
this turned out to be an **illusion**. Even after the initiation
*ritual* that he passed through in September 1994 nothing changed. And
after Harikesha Swami’s fall Bhakta das began to think of his spiritual
life very seriously and came to some important conclusions accordingly.

By the grace of the Lord he had a lucky opportunity to reside for a few
years in holy dhama Mayapura and to associate with the senior devotees,
its residents. That was an impetus for his spiritual progress. Thanks to
their association all the doubts dissipated from his head. In 1998,
after the GBC meeting, Bhakta das recommenced chanting pranama to |SP|,
having rejected everything **false**. The relationship with
Him recovered very fast and his faith in his *diksha-guru* |SP|
became intense and steadfast. He again began to experience
the joy, the feeling of self-fulfillment, which he used to have before.

Seeing the majority of devotees being deceived and remaining in
ignorance of the true position of |SP|, he became very eager
to tell the whole world about who |SP| really is. However
that time he had no qualification required to do it. But now the real
hour has struck to share with others this realization about |SP|’s
unequalled personality.

This topic of “\ **the bona fide**\ **diksha-guru**\ **of ISKCON**\ ”
has thrilled the minds of devotees for many years already and is still
remaining relevant today. For this reason Moscow devotees, who have
accepted |SP| as a **bona fide** *diksha-guru*, asked him to
write a “message” to all of the ISKCON devotees on this topic. He was
confused for some time having no idea how to write. He was not a writer
or scientist, he didn’t even have an academic education. But it happened
so that Gurudev himself had asked to help Him and request of the
spiritual master is something even more than an order. Desiring to
fulfill the will of his dear Gurudeva |SP| and hoping for
his mercy he set about this, may he say, titanic work for him. So please
be lenient to him.

Praying to the Lord, his eyes wet with tears, he begged for the
intelligence so that he could find the proper words to express the
thoughts boiling up within his heart, which he had suffered out. In this
book you’ll find revelation from Bhakta das which has come from the
deepest corner of his heart. And we concede that it may not be pleasant
for everyone. This book tells the truth and the truth only, the one that
we call ― *THE TRUTH*. And for those who are eager for this kind of
truth it shall be the curing nectar and this nectar is the breath of
Prabhupada himself. The book reflects the facts, the events, and the
historical chronicles and, unfortunately, the tragedy which is so
peculiar for the age of Kali full of darkest ignorance. And all these
incompatible things somehow could come together in our present-day
spiritual life.

This book is about the greatest personality who had granted the humanity
with the invaluable gift - the holy name of the Lord. Within the whole
material world there is nobody greater or equal to Him, His Divine Grace
|SP|. And from this book we can learn the most confidential
things about Him.

Bhakta dasa has been cheated and deceived many times in his life, and he
knows well how it feels to be deceived: it hurts indeed. Therefore he
has great compassion to those souls that are being cheated, especially
when it is related to their spiritual lives. In this book we are doing
our best to warn against deceit all the pious souls that are eager for
receive the precious treasure of spiritual knowledge so kindly given by
|SP|, and try to reveal the truth about the great deceit of
ISKCON gurus which has been lasting for almost thirty years already. It
is not the figment of our imagination neither the wishful thinking,
everything stated here is being confirmed by Sastras and documents.
Until we accept the shelter of the lotus feet of a **bona fide**
spiritual master, *the direct representative of Krishna*, we shall be
exposed to cheating and deceit again and again, lifetime after lifetime.

There are great changes coming to ISKCON. Krishna is sending us very
serious tryout, in which He wants to test our sincerity and devotion to
His true representative. Lord Krishna loves us and *willing*\ to help us
puts us in the situations where we are *forced to make the right
choice.*

If we pay proper attention to the events taking place in ISKCON at
present moment, if we see everything through the prism of scriptures and
declarations of will left by |SP|, then it becomes quite
evident that with the GBC guidance we are moving in wrong direction.

*At this moment we stand on threshold of great fulfillments.* Here has
come the time of exam, which Lord Krishna is arranging for us. Recall
what was happening five thousand years ago before beginning of the
battle on the Kurukshetra field. There occurred a division on two
parties, some have verged to Pandavas, who retaining patience and
condescension, others have verged to wicked sons of Dhritarashtra. So if
we draw an analogy between situation five thousand years ago and events
taking place presently in ISKCON, we will see very strong resemblance.

“Pandavas” — the genuine devotees of |SP|, the bona fide
representative of Lord Krishna, those who remain patient and forgiving.
They are eager to keep the ISKCON the way |SP| wants to see
it.

“The wicked sons of Dhritarashtra” — are
unauthorized ISKCON
gurus, who go against the Acharya rejecting the last order of |SP| (from July 9 1977).

Dear devotees, this example was brought up to turn your attention to the
extreme situation in
our society. GBC is fully lost and baffled, because they rejected the
order of |SP| (from July 9 1977). Presently for GBC, it is
very difficult to confess its own mistake and return to the last
instruction of |SP|. Therefore, it is necessary for us,
devotees, to puzzle out this complex situation together. Radical
measures should be taken to solve this global problem, for the general
good. In case of further delay, this situation can split our society not
into two but many parties, just as it happened with *Gaudya-math*.

This will happen because some devotees would choose |SP| as
**bona fide** *diksha-guru*, and others would *be verged to
self-appointed gurus of ISKCON*. Those who are financially dependent on
them would also *be verged* to the last. Unfortunately such motion is
already taking place in ISKCON. This can bring about serious problems in
spiritual field and discord between devotees. Is it really what |SP|
wanted? To prevent such oncoming catastrophe it is necessary
to unite into one joint family as it was bequeathed by |SP|.
And then all problems will fade away. We shall hope that this book will
help devotees to realize the importance, of this very relevant topic.

This book is like purification for us and it can serve others at least
as a guidance for making *the right choice*.

The time has come to discuss the basic principals given by our
acharyadeva which we were afraid to talk about for many years. Reading
the books of |SP| that had been changed and hearing the
perverted philosophy from unauthorized gurus we remain in ignorance of
the true position of |SP| *and our relationship with Him.*

*|SP| says*: **“**\ **Try to understand**\ **the philosophy
given in my books**\ ”. (S.P.lecture 23.09. 69)

In the same way we would like to formulate it: “Dear devotees please,
*try to understand* who |SP| is and what is His real mission
in this material world”.

This book is a humble attempt to present |SP| as He really
is. To specially stress the exceeding importance of His final Will and
those of His *orders,*\ which are presented in His books and letters,
which will help us to see Srila Prahupada in *true* light, to penetrate
and understand Him deeper as a personality which has no counterparts in
the whole human history.

This book is a devotional service to our dear gurudeva |SP|.
With all our sincerity we try to glorify Him here and protect Him from
the splitters and the enviers who try to snatch control over His name,
glory and heritage and thus damage the mission of Krishna Consciousness
Movement, the cradle of the World Spiritual Revolution. From the bottom
of the heart we pray and wish that all the devotees and all the sincere
souls who are attracted to this Krishna Consciousness Movement get
convinced that there is only ONE **bona fide** Acharya in our
*Gaudya-sampradaya*, and that is the founder-acharya His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.

Disciplic succession
============================================================================

His Divine Grace Shri Shrimad A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada – the
acharya-founder of International Krishna Consciousness Movement (ISKCON)
left this world on 14 of November 1977, but it doesn’t mean that |SP| 
died or He is death. **NO!!!** |SP| is alive, he
lives in his books, in his divine instructions. He lives in hearts of
his sincere devotees. He will never die, He will live forever. |SP|
is our eternal Guru. He is for *all of us* – the Bone Fide Spiritual Master!

Krishna devotees sing everyday offering prayers to spiritual master. And
we sincerely wish that everyone would fully realize to what kind of
personality we address this prayer:

   *saksad-dharitvena samasta-sastrair*

   *uktas tatha bhavyata eva sadbhih*

   *kintu prabhor yah priya eva tasya*

   *vande guroh sri-caranara vindam*

"In the revealed scriptures it is declared that the spiritual master
should be worshiped like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and this
injunction is *obeyed* by *pure devotees* of the Lord. The spiritual
master is the most confidential servant of the Lord. Thus let us offer
our respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of our spiritual master."

(“Science of Self-Realization”, chapter 2)

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada is that exact
person described in this verse - the **bona fide** spiritual master is
ONE because he belongs to the disciplic succession. |SP| is
a *direct representative* of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His
position is almost the same as that of Lord Krishna Himself. The whole
unbreakable disciplic succession speaks to us through his words carrying
the unchanged pure knowledge of Vedas. Any person who truly desires to
receive genuine knowledge should turn to such spiritual master and
accept his refuge by taking initiation.

*|SP| says:* “This knowledge is given by Supreme Lord, it
descends through Parampara, bone fide disciplic succession, **from one
realized soul to another**.”

In “Bhagavad gita“ (comments to verse 4.34) |SP| says: “The
path of spiritual realization is undoubtedly difficult. The Lord
therefore advises us to approach a **bona fide** spiritual master in the
*line of disciplic succession* from the Lord Himself. *No one can be
a*\ **bona fide**\ *spiritual master without following this principle of
disciplic succession.*\ ”

“Supreme Lord has explained in details in Bhagavad-gītā how one should
live and act in material world and how to get back home to God.
Therefore\ *one should not allow to be baffled by*\ **false teachers**,
fools and ignorant people. One should accept as one’s guru, mentor God
Himself, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However it is difficult to
understand the instructions God or Bhagavad-gītā without guru’s help.
**Therefore guru comes as a representative of
the**\ *\ *\ **parampara.”**

“There are four sampradāyas, or disciplic successions of knowledge and
transcendence, they are called the
`Brahma <http://vedabase.net/b/brahma>`__-`sampradāya <http://vedabase.net/s/sampradaya>`__,
`Rudra <http://vedabase.net/r/rudra>`__-`sampradāya <http://vedabase.net/s/sampradaya>`__,
`Śrī <http://vedabase.net/s/sri>`__-`sampradāya <http://vedabase.net/s/sampradaya>`__,
and
`Kumāra <http://vedabase.net/k/kumara>`__-`sampradāya <http://vedabase.net/s/sampradaya>`__.
`Sampradāya <http://vedabase.net/s/sampradaya>`__\ *-*\ `vihīnā <http://vedabase.net/v/vihina>`__\ `ye <http://vedabase.net/y/ye>`__\ *mantrās*\ `te <http://vedabase.net/t/te>`__\ `niṣphalā <http://vedabase.net/n/nisphala>`__\ `matāḥ <http://vedabase.net/m/matah>`__.
The knowledge of the Supreme received from such a
`sampradāya <http://vedabase.net/s/sampradaya>`__, or disciplic
succession, can give one enlightenment. If one does not take to the path
of disciplic succession, it is not possible for one to understand the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one understands the Supreme Lord
through devotional service with faith in the disciplic succession and
then advances further, he awakens his natural love for God, and then his
success in life is assured.”

(Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 7.7.17 |SP|’s commentary)

We belong to *Brahma-sampradaja*. Since Sri Chaytaniya Mahaprabhu joined
this *sampradaja* it was called *Brahma-Madhva-Gauḍiya-sampradaja*, or
simply *Gauḍiya-sampradaja*. In Bhagavad-gītā |SP| quotes
*guru-parampara* - Brahma, Narada, Viyasa and so on up to |SP|.
After Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur passed away
deflections began in our *guru-parampara*. This deflections used to
happen every time when great acharyas left this world. For instance:
sects deviating from His teaching appeared immediately after Shri
Chaytania Mahaprabhu left his body. In times of Vishvanath Chakravarti
Thakur these kind of deviate sects have brought about decay of *Gauḍiya–Vaiṣṇavism*,
also in times of Bhaktivinod Thakur there appeared some
sects. It’s a common problem of *Kali Yuga*.

Just in the same manner right after Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur’s
departure deflections began in our guru-parampara. Just before leaving
this material world Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur has said to his
disciples following:

"Create GBC and co-operate. Wait and acharya will appear among you".

But they went against His will and acted on their own whimsies, giving
for His will their own figments and finally, as we see, the division
into multiple maths occurred and each has his own unauthorized
*acharya*. This is how apasampradayas or sects are formed. Sects are
those organizations which have swayed from the teachings of Sri Caytanya
Mahaprabhu and do not accept the authority of acharyas from the *bona
fide* decsiplic succession. Exactly in the same way after our *acharya*
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada died his disciples went against His
instructions and deviated from His teachings.

His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada is an
acharya-founder of International Society for Krishna Consciousnesses (ISKCON). 
Four months before his death |SP| has written his
Declaration of will and publishes directive from July 9 1977 (see
"appendix"), where He states his last will very clearly. And will of
acharya is a will of God. Also in his books |SP| describes
how ISKCON society is supposed to function after his departure and
during the whole period of its existence. |SP| states
following:

"In our `Krsna <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/k/krsna>`__ consciousness
movement, the requirement is that one must be prepared to give up the
four pillars of sinful life -- illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication
and gambling. In Western countries especially, we first observe whether
a potential disciple is prepared to follow the regulative principles.
Then he is given the name of a
`Vaisnava <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/v/vaisnava>`__\ servant and
initiated to chant the `Hare <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/h/hare>`__
`Krsna <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/k/krsna>`__
`maha <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/m/maha>`__\ *-*\ `mantra <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/m/mantra>`__,
at least sixteen rounds daily. In this way the disciple renders
devotional service under the guidance of the spiritual master or **his
representative** for at least six months to a year. He is then
recommended for a second initiation, during which a sacred thread is
offered and the disciple is accepted as a bona fide
`brahmana <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/b/brahmana>`__."

(`Sri Caitanya Caritamrta <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/en2>`__,
Madhya, 24.330)

"Thus in the beginning the students of our
`Krishna <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/k/krsna>`__ consciousness
movement agree to live with devotees, and gradually, having given up
four prohibited activities -- illicit sex, gambling, meat-eating and
intoxication -- they become advanced in the activities of spiritual
life. When one is found to be regularly following these principles, he
is given the first initiation
(`hari <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/h/hari>`__\ *-*\ `nama <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/n/nama>`__),
and he regularly chants at least sixteen rounds a day. Then, after six
months or a year, he is initiated for the second time and given the
sacred thread with the regular sacrifice and rituals."

(`Sri Caitanya Caritamrta <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/en2>`__,
Adi\ **,**\ 17.265)

"Due to the necessity of these activities, we do not immediately
initiate disciples in the International Society for Krishna
Consciousness. For six months, a candidate for initiation must first
attend `arati <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/a/arati>`__\ and classes in
the *sastras*, practice the regulative principles and associate with
other devotees. When one is actually advanced in the
`purascarya <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/p/purascarya>`__\ *-*\ `vidhi <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/v/vidhi>`__,
he is recommended by the local temple president for initiation. It is
not that anyone can be suddenly initiated without meeting the
requirements. When one is further advanced by chanting the
`Hare <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/h/hare>`__
`Krishna <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/k/krsna>`__
`mantra <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/m/mantra>`__ sixteen rounds
daily, following the regulative principles and attending classes, he
receives the sacred thread (*brahminical*\ recognition) after the second
six months."

(`Sri Caitanya Caritamrta <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/en2>`__,
Madhiya, 15.108)

Right after our *acharya* |SP| died His eleven
representatives stopped fulfilling their **ritvika** (the priests)
duties as they used to do in His physical presence. They were supposed
to conduct the initiation ritual both first and second one on behalf of
|SP|. Instead they mystically became *diksha-gurus*.
According to directive (from July 9 1977), this **ritvik-system** should
be followed as long as The International Society for Krishna Consciousnesses (ISKCON) exists.
Though this directive is very short in
its content, still *it is thrice said there that all initiated disciples
should become disciples of |HDGSP|*.

Prabhupadas order from July 9 1977 was rejected and his representatives
declared themselves an acharyas, *diksha-gurus*, single successors. They
divided between themselves onto eleven zones the whole Society which was
created by |SP| with such a care and covered almost whole
planet. Thereby, having secured property, money and big amount of
disciples for themselves they got long expected possibility to dominate,
each in his zone. This system of **zonal-acharyas** which lasted for ten
years initiated a great deceit of ISKCON-gurus.

Even after fall of so many "gurus" (out of these 11 *ritviks*) GBC never
admitted their mistakes and never restored *ritvik-system* installed by
|SP|, instead they brought about dozen more gurus, having
declared that actually any of |SP|’s disciples can be a
candidate for a *diksha-guru*. Those who wish to, must submit an
application to GBC for consideration. This second lie lasts up to today
and it is becoming more and more evident that GBC has got totally lost
and came to a dead end in their efforts to present their own *sidhanta*.

For this very reason some of ISKCON gurus refused to give initiation.
Though, unfortunately, up to now they have not shown any activity in
recovering the authentic system of initiation, installed by |SP|.

"Devotees always humbly show their respect, but when it comes to the
discussion of sastras they do not keep up usual etiquette and speak only
truth even if this might be unpleasant for someone".

In this book we stick to this rule and therefore it may be unpleasant
for someone.

To have `adequate
substantiation <http://www.multitran.ru/c/m.exe?t=1769303_1_2>`__, we
have to bring facts and name some of the
`unauthorized <http://www.multitran.ru/c/m.exe?t=1029735_1_2>`__ gurus
zealously defending their illegal position of *diksha-guru*.

*Though, some of the GBC members do admit the fact that there was no
assignment for becoming a Diksha-guru.*

For instance:

"**Actually Prabhupada never appointed any gurus, he appointed eleven
ritviks.\ He\ never appointed them gurus**".

(Tamala-Krishna Gosvami (1946-2002), Talk in Pyramid House, Topanga -
canyon, 3.12. 1980)

"|SP| did not appoint anyone to be guru for the future".

(Jayadvayta Svami, elected guru of ISKCON, video-debate in San-diego
1990)

**“And it’s a fact that |SP| never said “Alright here is the
next acarya, or here is the next eleven acaryas and they are authorized
gurus for the Movement, for the world”. He did not do that.”**

(Ravindra Svarupa das, San Diego debate, 1990)

Our International Society for Krishna Consciousness ― is a big family
created with love by |SP|, where He is a father for ALL OF
US. However, presently there appeared a number of so called "fathers"
who have unlawfully undertaken functions of *diksha-gurus*, having
proclaimed themselves acharyas, representatives of God.

Preaching the deviate philosophy contradicting with *sidhanta* installed
by |SP|, GBC have transformed ISKCON into number of separate
groups. Which has discredited our Society in the eyes of the world.

To justify their illegal position of *diksha-guru* they bring up many
false arguments, giving them for the will of |SP|.

For instance:

Sivarama Svami, elected guru of ISKCON, says: "The law of diciplic
succession tells that diciple **accepts living spiritual master**,
living in a sense of **physical presence**."

(Journal "ISKCON", Gaura - purnima 1990)

This statement of Sivarama Svami is absolute fabrication and has nothing
to do with the teaching of |SP|. Such a "law" simply does
not exist. We will never come across such a statement in any of |SP| books or records of His speeches.

|SP| gives following determination of disciplic succession
(*parampara*):

"**Parampara means to hear the truth from spiritual master.** Disciplic
succession doesn’t always mean that one should be officially initiated.
Disciplic succession means to **accept the disciplic conclusion**".

(Conversation with |SP|, 20.12.1976)

This *conclusion* – is a concept of "No change" in ISKCON, and GBC must
faultlessly follow this concept. In other words this **disciplic
conclusion** is final instruction of |SP| from (from July 9
1977).

|SP|: " **So although a physical body (of spiritual master)
is not present, the vibration should be accepted as the presence of the
spiritual master, vibration.**\ What we have heard from the spiritual
master,\ **that is living**".

(|SP|, lecture 13. 01.1969, Los-Angeles)

There is one more example, where Hridayananda das Gosvami,
self-appointed ISKCON guru defends his illegal position (*diksha-guru*)
and states the body concept of LIVING guru. He says: "As to chain of
diciplic succession, |SP| considered His **physical presence
very essential** for the matter of that".

(The co-author of the GBC book "Prabhupada’s order”)

Here is what |SP| speaks on this topic himself: "Such
association with Krsna and the spiritual master should be association by
vibration, **not physical presence**. That is real association".

(“Elevation to Krishna Consciousness”, chapter 4)

"**Although physically we are not together**, we are not separated
spiritually. So we should be concerned only with this spiritual
connection”.

(Letter of |SP| to Gaurasundari)

On spiritual level there is no difference between guru and his
teachings:

*|SP| says:* "**There is no difference between the spiritual
master's instructions and the spiritual master himself. In his absence,
therefore, his words of direction should be the pride of the
disciple**."

(Śrī Caitanya Caritāmṛta Adi 1.35 commentary)

In spite of everything GBC persistently continues to impose the body
concept of LIVING guru.

More amazing is that we devotees continue to believe them. |SP|
has never stated this kind of nonsense. It was physically
impossible for Prabhupada to know all of his disciples, nevertheless
they got the initiation and did become his disciples. Thereby initiation
does not require physical presence of the guru. If Prabhupada is not
present at the planet on physical level, it does not necessarily mean
that he is dead and no more. He is and He is spiritually present with
us.

"So that is called *prakata*, **physically** present. And there is
another phrase, which is called *aprakata*, not physically present. But
that does not mean, Krsna is dead or God is dead. That does not mean,
*prakata* or *aprakata*, **physically present or not**\ present, it does
not matter."

(Lecture of |SP|, 11.12.1973 Los Angeles)

“I went to your country for spreading this information of Krsna
Consciousness and you are helping me in my mission, although **I am not
physically present there** but spiritually I am always with you."

(Letter of |SP| to Nandarani, Krishna devi and Subali
3.10.1967)

In "Mahabharata” it is described how Dharmaraja addresses Maharaja
Yudhishthira with four questions. One of these questions is – *kah
panthah*? - "We are perplexed, what is the real way?" It Is Said:
“\ *nana munira nana mata, yata mata tata patha.*\ ” "How many sages -
so many roads. We are in confusion. **Where is that one-way, which is
worth to go?**"

Presently there are 80 "sages" in ISKCON and consequently as many roads.
Knowing no right way they are confused just like many of us. Here is
what one of the GBC chairman’s says:

"How will we deal with our polarized and disintegrating society; how
will we confront our conflicting moral claims? [ ] If we ask why ISKCON
now finds itself in such an impossible position, we can only conclude
that is must be due to the continuing reactions to our own sins and
offenses. Thus, the GBC (and ISKCON) still needs to atone for its sins
and its offenses, acknowledged and unacknowledged. I have been praying
and struggling to understand what I can do about this, as I feel the
heavy responsibility to do something, but I also feel the situation
extremely difficult--I cannot see any mundane solution--and anyway my
powers of action are limited, even though I also feel I was elected by
the GBC this year to somehow do something. *So I have been baffled and
in much distress*."

(Message from GBC Chairman Ravindra Svarupa, directed by e-mail to GBC
members with regards to the case with the "guru" Danurdhary Svami who is
accused in abuse of children.)

*|SP| says*: "There is uncertainty when you do not accept
the reality. The reality is God and **His direct representative**. If we
do not accept His representative, then our position is very uncertain".

(“Dialectical Spiritualism”)

"**Mahajana – is ONE and straight way to the transcendental world is
also one**".

("The Science of Self Realization" ch. 2)

The easiest decision is to surrender |SP|, the bona fide
**Mahajnani** – and accept the truth coming directly from His Divine
mouths. And thus all the problems solve themselves automatically. But
our trouble is that due to our delusion we try to understand |SP|
through false teachers who are not pure mediums. For this
reason it becomes so difficult to understand and accept the truth coming
from |SP| directly.

Nevertheless the truth remains the truth, irrespective of whether it is
in our mind or not, truth is absolute. And those who sincerely surrender
to |SP| are able to perceive It.

|SP| says:

"If we want to know something about God, we should receive knowledge
from Him directly, or from a person who knows Him. This is the direction
given in Bhagavad-gītā:

`tad <http://vedabase.net/t/tad>`__\ `viddhi <http://vedabase.net/v/viddhi>`__\ `praṇipātena <http://vedabase.net/p/pranipatena>`__\ `paripraśnena <http://vedabase.net/p/pariprasnena>`__\ `sevayā <http://vedabase.net/s/sevaya>`__

`upadekṣyanti <http://vedabase.net/u/upadeksyanti>`__\ `te <http://vedabase.net/t/te>`__\ `jñānaḿ <http://vedabase.net/j/jnanam>`__\ *jñāninas*\ `tattva <http://vedabase.net/t/tattva>`__\ *-*\ `darśinaḥ <http://vedabase.net/d/darsinah>`__

**“Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.
Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The
self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the
truth."** (B.g. 4.34). The word
`tattva <http://vedabase.net/t/tattva>`__\ *-*\ `darśinaḥ <http://vedabase.net/d/darsinah>`__\ refers
to one who actually knows about God. It is necessary to learn about God
from **one who have seen Him eye to eye**".

(“Dialectical Spiritualism”)

*|SP| says*: "*Sadhu-sastra-guru.*\ We can approach God by
understanding a *saintly person*, studying Vedic scriptures and
following the instructions of the **bona fide** spiritual master.
*Sadhu, sastras and guru* should corroborate. A *sadhu* – is one who
talks in terms of the scriptures, and the *guru* – is one who teaches
according to the scriptures. A *guru* can not manufacture words that are
not in the *sastras*. When we receive instructions from all three, we
can progress perfectly in our understanding of Supreme Personality of
Godhead".

(“Dialectical Spiritualism”)

|SP| is a **bona fide** *diksha-guru*\ for all of us. He
gives us transcendental knowledge (*divya-jnana*) or initiation,
withdrawing our karma, by means of his books. And he is that saintly
*sadhu* whose word always remain in the frames of scriptures. Prabhupada
― is a *sadhu*, who has given commentary on holy scriptures. For us he
is also a *shiksha-guru* since we receive instructions through His
books. If we try to understand |SP| through arbitrators
(mediators) surrendering to them and meditating on them we will never
approach God.

*|SP| says:*"*Prema-bhakti* can be only developed by the
grace of **bona fide** spiritual master, *sad-guru* - and no other
ways".

(“Dialectical Spiritualism”)

Our ISKCON gurus can *only* be instructing gurus or *shiksha-gurus* but
they should not preach that what disagrees with *sadhu* - |SP|.

*Prabhupada said*: "*Shiksha-guru* who gives instructions contradicting
with the instructions of the spiritual master, is not a true
*shiksha-guru*. This is a daemon... *Shiksha-guru* can not give
instructions contradicting with the instructions of *diksha-guru*. This
not a *shiksha-guru*. This is rascal".

(Lecture on Bhagavad Gita, Hong kong, July 4 1974)

Even after such statement of |SP| they still go on preaching
distorted philosophy of *guru-tattva*\ contradicting with His teaching
and claim to be what they shouldn’t be. All books of |SP|
are holy scriptures and in all of them He speaks of *the bona fide* guru
- **sad-guru** in singular. And 80 bone fide gurus are out of question.

**“Therefore, if the Absolute Truth is one, about which we think there
is no difference of opinion, the guru also cannot be**\ **two**\ **."**

"The guru is one because he comes in disciplic succession. [ ]The real
guru cannot be two, for the real guru does not speak differently from
his predecessors".

("Science of Self-Realization" ch. 2)

We all well understand what means word "chain": section following
section and as a result they form chain. In similar way chain of
spiritual masters or the disciplic succession is *from one realized soul
to another*. This is identified *parampara*. However if we take into
consideration philosophy of "*guru-tattva*" which is imposed by ISKCON
“gurus” it becomes evident that it disagrees with above stated. It turns
out that after |SP| there are 80 "sections" simultaneously
instead of common “one”. Excuse me, but this is already a bunch of
grapes rather than chain of *parampara*. This totally disagrees with
that very tradition which they love to refer to when it is useful for
them.

*|SP| says*: "One should act according to the order of
`Kṛṣṇa <http://vedabase.net/k/krsna>`__. This is a very important point.
That order of `Kṛṣṇa <http://vedabase.net/k/krsna>`__ comes through
disciplic succession from the **bona fide** spiritual master. Therefore
the spiritual master's order should be taken as the prime duty of life.
If one gets a **bona fide** spiritual master and acts according to his
direction, then one's *perfection* of life in
`Kṛṣṇa <http://vedabase.net/k/krsna>`__ consciousness is *guaranteed*".

(Bhagavad gita 18.57 commentary)

All holy scriptures speak of dedicated service to Krishna *under the
guidance of His representative,* who at this present time is |SP|.

*|SP| says*: "…But all such activities must be in
relationship with `Kṛṣṇa <http://vedabase.net/k/krsna>`__. This
relationship is established by connecting oneself with the **bona fide**
spiritual master, who is the *direct representative
of*\ `Kṛṣṇa <http://vedabase.net/k/krsna>`__\ *in disciplic
succession*".

("Nectar of devotion", introduction)

"Regarding *parampara* system: *There is nothing to wonder for big gaps*
[…] we find in the Bhagavad-gītā that the Gītā was taught to the sun god
some *millions of years ago*, but Krishna has mentioned *only three
names* in this *parampara* system-namely, Vivasvan, Manu and Iksvaku;
and so these gaps do not hamper from understanding the *parampara*
system. **We have to pick up the
prominent**\ *\ *\ **acharya**\ *\ *\ **and follow him.**\ [...] We have
to pick up from the authority of the *acharya* in whatever *sampradaya*
we belong to".

(|SP| letter to Dayananda 12.4.1968)

**"…In order to receive the real message
of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam one
should approach the spiritual master who represents the chain of
disciplic succession at this moment."**

(Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, 2.9.7 commentary)

With this statement |SP| explains that we cannot get the
transcendental knowledge (the *divya-jnana*) or in other words
initiation from any other *acharya* in the line of our *parampara*
avoiding |SP|. The reason is that |SP| is that
very person who at this time presents the chain of disciplic succession.

Disciplic succession or *guru-parampara* is eternal and there can be no
discussion about its discontinuation. |SP| has installed the
*ritvik-system*. **Ritviks**\ do belong to this *parampara* and will
present |SP|. **New disciples** also belong to this
*parampara* and will present Him. **His books** will present Him; **His
society**\ will present Him; **His murti** will present Him. The chain
cannot be broken just because spiritual master has physically left this
planet. The Initiation means *spiritual*, transcendental connection
between master and his disciple. Spiritual knowledge is given through
*Vani* (transcendental sound) rather than physical contact. Having
imperfect senses nobody is able to send this divine sound,
*shabda-brahma*. Only His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada 
direct representative of Lord Krishna standing in the chain
of *bona fide* disciplic succession is able to transmit this divine
sound.

Our unauthorized ISKCON gurus initiate their followers with *Hare
Krishna mantra* and *Gayatri mantra* and people receiving these
*mantras* certainly hope to advance spiritually and reach perfection.
Holy scriptures say that *diksha-guru* who gives mantra must be the
**siddha purusha**\ *in that mantra* which he gives and besides be
authorized by Supreme Lord. Otherwise this mantra has no power.

“As it is said in the Padma Purana:

sampradaya-vihina ye

mantras te nisphala matah

"Unless you are initiated by a **bona fide** spiritual master *in the
disciplic succession, the\ *\ **mantra**\ that you might have received
**is without any effect**".

"On the other hand, one who has received the transcendental knowledge by
**aural**\ reception from the *bona fide preceptor in the disciplic
chain*, and who has sincere regard for the *real acarya*, must needs be
enlightened with the revealed knowledge of the Vedas. **But this
knowledge is permanently sealed to the cognitive approach of the
empiricists**".

(“Science of Self-Realization”gl. 2)

"The `ācārya <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/a/acarya>`__\ gives the
suitable method for crossing the ocean of nescience by accepting the
boat of the Lord's lotus feet, and if this method is strictly followed,
the followers will ultimately reach the destination, by the grace of the
Lord. This method is called
`ācārya <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/a/acarya>`__\ *-*\ `sampradāya <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/s/sampradaya>`__\ *.*
It is therefore said,
`sampradāya <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/s/sampradaya>`__\ *-*\ `vihīnā <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/v/vihina>`__\ `ye <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/y/ye>`__\ *mantrās*\ `te <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/t/te>`__\ `niṣphalā <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/n/nisphala>`__\ `matāḥ <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/m/matah>`__
(`Padma <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/p/padma>`__
`Purāṇa <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/p/purana>`__). The
`ācārya <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/a/acarya>`__\ *-*\ `sampradāya <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/s/sampradaya>`__
is strictly bona fide. *Therefore one must accept
the*\ `ācārya <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/a/acarya>`__\ *-*\ `sampradāya <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/s/sampradaya>`__\ *;
otherwise one's endeavor will be futile*".

(Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 10.2.31 commentary)

*|SP| said*: "So person should not allow himself to be
cheated by miscellaneous *false-teacher, fools and ignorant people*".

Receiving these *mantras* from self-appointed gurus we can go on
repeating them for millions of lives. We must attentively listen to
|SP|, then we shall not be baffled by different false
teachers.

By matter of chance we were lucky to get acquainted with the book of
Gour Govinda Svami "The Grace of Guru". Let us quote a small fragment
from this book where Gour Govinda Svami confirms following:

**Devotee:** Is physical presence of a guru necessary?

**Srila Gour Govinda Svami**: Oh yes! After all he is personality, he is
not impersonal.

**Devotee:** That is to say it is not possible to simply say: "Well I
read the books?".

**Srila Gour Govinda Svami**: Books say: accept a guru. Take into
consideration that there should be *pranipata, pariprashna*\ and *seva*.
Surrender, serve and ask - who, whom? The Books?”

Let's see what |SP| speaks on this topic himself:

"*Physical presence is*\ **immaterial**\ *.* Presence of the
transcendental sound received from the Spiritual Master should be the
guidance of life. That will make our spiritual life successful. If you
feel very strongly about my absence you may place my pictures on my
sitting places and this will be source of inspiration for you."

(Letter from |SP| to Brahmananda and other disciples,
19.01.1967)

**|SP|**: “ Even a moments association with a pure devotee -
all success!

**Revatinanda:** “ Does that apply to reading the words of a pure
devotee?

**|SP|**: “Yes”.

(Room conversation with |SP|, 13.12.1970)

**Paramahamsa:** “ My question is, a pure devotee, when he comments on
Bhagavad Gita, someone who never sees him physically, but he just comes
in contact with the commentary, explanation, is this the same thing?”

**|SP|:** “ **Yes**. You can associate with Krishna by
reading Bhagavad-gītā. And these saintly persons, they have given their
explanations, comments. So where is the difficulty?”

(Walk with |SP| 11.06. 1974 Paris.)

This brings up the question: How did Gour Govinda Maharaja handle
without physical presence of his own spiritual master |SP|
for almost twenty years? Whom did he address his questions all this time
if Prabhupada was not physically present? Whom did he serve if
Prabhupada was physically absent? What could he realize from holy books
having such a consciousness? Maharaja writes: "books speak". Books
themselves cannot speak it is **bona fide** *sad-guru*\ who speaks
through them and he lives in them. If someone *considers
sad-guru*\ |SP| to be death and thinks that this gives him
right to pervert His philosophy, he is making a big mistake.
Bhagavad-gītā – is direct revelation of Lord Krishna and is not
different from Him and one can worship and address his quest to
Bhagavad-gītā.

“The Bhagavad-gītā is identical with Krsna; and because Krsna is the
Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no difference between
Krsna and His words. Therefore the Bhagavad-gītā is as worshipable as
Lord Krsna Himself, both being absolute. One who hears the Bhagavad-gītā
"as is" actually hears the words directly from the lotus lips of the
Lord”.

(“Science of Self-Realization” The Immortal Nectar of the Bhagavad-gītā)

Srila Gour Govinda Maharaja very skillfully falsifies meanings of the
assigned questions so that answers come in accordance with false concept
of unauthorized ISKCON gurus. In this way he diminishes the true
position of |SP|.

Self-appointed ISKCON gurus try to confirm the\ **body**\ *concept of
"LIVING" guru* in every way. This kind of statements can be declared
only by someone who looks at spiritual matters through prism of his
false EGO, which dictates him: “\ **I’m this body**, so I need
"Guru-body!". This has nothing to do with Krishna consciousness.
Spiritual knowledge is given through *Vani*, (the transcendental sound),
rather than physical contact. Our material senses are imperfect
therefore shastras advise us to look at everything through prism of
shastras since we are unable to see directly. *|SP| speaks*:
**"Spiritual Master ― is a Principle, rather than body".**

**Journalist:** What will happen to Movment of the Krishna consciousness
in United States after you die?

**|SP|**: I will never die.

**Devotee:** *Jaya! Haribol*! (smiling)

**|SP|:** **I shall live in my books**, and you will be
using them.

(|SP|, press-conference, 16.7.1975., San-Francisco)

"**I will remain your personal mentor**\ **,** weather I am physically
present or not, just as I get *personal* contact from my Guru Maharaja".

(Conversation with |SP| 14.7.1977, Vrindavan)

“I will always be with you. Don’t worry even **if I
am**\ **physically**\ **absent".**

(Letter of |SP| to Jayananda, 16.09.1967)

It seems that Gour Govinda Maharaja does not considers, that he himself
causes *guru-appa-ratha* and asks devotee following:

**Shrila Gour Govinda Svami:** "What is the most heaviest
*nama-apa-ratha*".

**Devotee**: "*To neglect* the instructions of the spiritual master".

Devotee didn’t give the full answer and wasn’t exact enough. There are
ten insults which are necessary to avoid while chanting holy name of
God.

*The third one state*: "**To reject**\ *the instructions of
the*\ **spiritual master residing in the chain of desciplic
succession**\ **".**

Unfortunately all unauthorized ISKCON gurus cause one of the most
serious *nama-apa-ratha* - **reject** last **order** (from July 9 1977)
of their *spiritual master* |SP|, representative of Supreme
Personality of Godhead, residing in the **chain of disciplic
succession**.

Let us conduct one more analysis of Sivarama Svami "statements" in this
regard:

In his book "*Shiksha-guru*" Sivarama Svami confirms following:

"*Diksha-guru* – is an *embodiment*\ of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead". Yes, we can agree with this statement. *Bona fide*
*diksha-guru* is manifestation of Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then
after Maharaja states: "*Diksha-guru* can be liberated as well as not
yet liberated".

With this statement Maharaja disagrees with himself. First he says that
diksha-guru is embodiment of the God and then after declares that
conditioned soul can be a *diksha-guru*. Can embodiment of the God be a
conditioned soul? This is how they defraud simple-hearted people
disorienting them. Sometimes they quote text 5 from the "Nectar of
Instruction" (commentary) to prove that **"A neophyte Vaisnava or a
Vaisnava situated on the intermediate platform can also accept disciples
…"**

However, for some reason, they never notice the remaining portion of the
sentence which warns disciples of such a "guru" that **"it should be
understood that they cannot advance very well toward the ultimate goal
of life under his**\ **insufficient guidance.**\ **"** Further it is
stated:

**"Therefore a disciple should be careful to accept
an**\ **uttama-adhikäré**\ **as a spiritual master."**

Unskilled *gurus* are also warned:

**"One should not become a spiritual master unless he has attained the
platform of**\ **uttama-adhikäré**\ **."**

(“Nectar of Instruction" text 5 commentary)

Here is the only fragment from |SP|’s books where term
*"Diksha*" (*dikshitah*) is connected with necessity of qualification:

(C.C, Madhiya, 24.330, commentary)

*We will give one more statement of Sivarama Swami from his book
"Shiksha-guru":*

Sivarama Swami writes: "One of deviations related to *diksha* is known
as *ritvik* system. Being ignorant about *Vaiṣṇava traditions* devotees
prone to fall into error and consider that Prabhupada continues to give
the spiritual initiation not even being personally present. The
importance which is given to fictitious *diksha* system, promotes the
increase of the *ritvik* philosophy followers, where devotees do not
understand, neither what is *shiksha* nor that through it the
relationship with |SP| is established. Disappointed senior
devotees, whose management was degraded to “advice” of smaller
importance at the best and who have no illusion about the results of
*diksha*, existing in ISKCON, become an easy mark and then after a
preachers of the *ritvik-vada* philosophy".

Sivarama Svami tries to convince readers that *ritvik-system* is not
authoritative, by bringing forth his own false arguments, even though it
came into play since 1975, and was subsequently approved by directive
from (the July 9 1977) and signed personally by |SP|. This
kind of statements are nothing but an insult of our spiritual master
|SP| and the whole parampara. It is necessary for us to
follow this system, since this was an order of *acharya* -
representative of God. And as to initiation matter we can say that |SP| 
continues to give it through his own books, which are
representing Him. Thereby it is transmitted through
*vani*\ (transcendental sound), rather than physical contact, as it was
already discussed above. According to directive duties of these
*ritviks* (priests) are simply to accept devote into Society as
initiated disciple of |SP|, conduct the *ritual of
initiations*, chant on the beads and give him a spiritual name, since he
is *already initiated* by |SP| through His books.

Dear readers, from this books you will know what actually *diksha* is
and what means *divya-jnana*, from whom do we get it, how the initiation
process takes place etc. Maharaja writes that devotees abide in
ignorance... Better to be ignorant about Vaiṣṇava traditions *alien* to
|SP|, than to be in position of the *apostate* rejecting
instructions of one’s own spiritual master. It is great that devotees
are finally starting to understand that only by grace of **bona fide**
*sad-guru* it becomes possible to get free from bonds of *Maya*
(illusion). Is it really an illusion to surrender to the **bona fide**
representative of God ― |SP|? The biggest illusion is to
consider oneself a representative of God and give this lie for the truth
to others.

*|SP| said*: **"Traditions ― it’s all material. Our single
tradition is to satisfy Lord Vishnu".**

(Lecture on B.g. 30.07. 1973 London)

It becomes possible to satisfy Lord Vishnu only through his
representative - |SP| and in no other way.

*|SP|*: According to Vedic instructions, we must have a guru
in order to acquire perfect knowledge.

`tad <http://vedabase.net/t/tad>`__\ *-vijñānārtham*\ `sa <http://vedabase.net/s/sa>`__\ `gurum <http://vedabase.net/g/gurum>`__\ *evābhigacchet*

`samit <http://vedabase.net/s/samit>`__\ *-*\ `pānih <http://vedabase.net/p/panih>`__\ *śrotriyam*\ `brahma <http://vedabase.net/b/brahma>`__\ *-*\ `nishtham <http://vedabase.net/n/nistham>`__

"In order to learn the transcendental science, one must approach the
**bona fide**\ *spiritual master* in disciplic succession, who is fixed
in the Absolute Truth." (Mundaka Upanishad 1.2. 12). *The guru must
factually be a representative of God.*\ He must have *seen* and
experienced God in fact, not simply in t\ *heory*. We have to approach
such a guru and by service, surrender and sincere inquiry we can come to
understand what is God. The Vedas inform us that a person can understand
God when he has received a little mercy from His Lordship; otherwise, he
may speculate for millions and millions of years".

(“Dialectical Spiritualism”)

*|SP| says*: “It is necessary to learn about God from one
**who has seen Him eye to eye**\ ”.

“If a person does not directly the orders of God, he can not be a **bona
fide** *guru*\ ”.

(“Dialectical Spiritualism”)

|SP| says these words especially for us, so that we do not
become victims of deceit. Each of His word – is a clear nectar pouring
out from His Divine mouth.

Can any of these 80 “gurus” really say that he sees God and receives
direct instructions from Him?

In each book |SP| recommends us to address a **bona fide**
spiritual master with all *sincerity* and open heart. So let's open our
hearts and place with love |SP| in the very core of it. He
will live there and open the *true* knowledge for us.

In Sri Ishopanishad (commentary to mantra 13) |SP| says:

"Nowhere in authentic scriptures is it said that one will ultimately
reach the same goal by doing anything or *worshiping anyone*. Such
foolish theories are offered by *self-made "spiritual masters"*\ who
have no connection with the
`paramparā <http://vedabase.net/p/parampara>`__, the *bona fide* system
of disciplic succession."

In this book |SP| brings an example of demigods and
mayavadi. But this does not mean that these words are applicable only to
them. All He says has a deep meaning, these particular words are equally
applicable to all of us and to all spiritual masters.

In commentary to Bhagavad-gītā (4.34.) it is said that blindly following
spiritual master is *condemned*. So we should use our intellegence to
know whom to worship, whom to follow and where shall we arrive. Our
ISKCON “gurus” can not occupy the position of *diksha-guru* ― they do
not belong to *parampara* -*a true chain of disciplic succession,*
because they have rejected the order of their spiritual master. And the
order of the master is not different from himself…

**"...disciplic succession does not always mean that one has to be
initiated officially. Disciplic succession means to accept the disciplic
conclusion."**

(Letter of |SP| to Dinesh. 3.10.1969)

In other words: **disciplic conclusion** means ― final instruction of
|SP| (from July 9 1977) and GBC must strictly follow this
instruction.

In a very important interviews on the topic of *parampara* and its
continuation before and after His physical death, |SP| has
said following:

**“Ganesa**: |SP|, if the knowledge was handed down by the
saintly kings, *evam parampara-praptam* [Bg. 4.2], how is it that the
knowledge was lost?

**Prabhupada**: When it was not handed down. Simply understood by
speculation. Or if it is not handed down as it is. They might have made
some changes. Or they did not hand it down. Suppose I handed it down to
you, but if you do not do that, then it is lost. Now the Krishna
consciousness movement is going on in my presence. Now **after my
departure**, if you do not do this, then it is lost. **If you go on as
you are doing now,**\ then it will go on. But if you stop... (end)”

(Conversation, 9.5.75, Pert, Australia)

To accept the disciplic conclusion means to continue the activities the
way they were performed at His physical presence – to stay **ritviks**
and continue to initiate on behalf of |SP|, according to His
last instruction (from July 9 1977). |SP| states that
Saṅkīrtana Movement will exist for 10.000 years on. Within this time
|SP| was, is and will remain the present section in the
chain of disciplic succession – the **bona fide** *diksha-guru* of our
*Gaudya-sampradaya.*

"if there is no discipline, there can not be disciples. Disciple means
one who follows discipline".

(|SP|, 8.03.1976 Mayapur)

**" One should take initiation from a bona fide spiritual master coming
in the disciplic succession, who is authorized by his predecessor
spiritual master. I his is
called**\ `dīkshā <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/d/diksa>`__\ **-**\ `vidhāna <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/v/vidhana>`__\ **."**

(S.B. 4.8.54, commentary)

Attentively reading |SP| books and humbly listening to Him
we can understand that none of ISKCON gurus got from |SP| an
authorization to become a *diksha-guru*. There was nothing presented to
prove that |SP| has ordered someone to become a
*diksha-guru*. Indeed everyone who is attracted to this Movement becomes
a member of this enormous ISKCON family. Thereby one becomes a disciple
of |SP|. Then he shouldn’t stay indifferent to what is going
on with his "FAMILY".

Each of us understands well that |SP| – is a
founder-\ *acharya* of this Great Worldwide Movement for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)
and is the highest authority for each of us and
for the ISKCON as a whole. The solemn duty of each honest devotee is to
accept the *last order from July 9 1977* as a highest will of our
*acharya* |SP| and follow it spreading His teaching without
altering, deviating not even for a one jot.

We could give many more proves that His Divine Grace |SP| is
*the only bona fide Diksha-guru* for the whole International Society of
Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). He is present and alive in his books, in
his Divine instructions, in the hearts of his sincere devotees and his
Grace is granted to the ones who serve Him with love and faith.

True devotees of |SP|
======================================================

Dear readers, we are happy to present you a short description, full of
nectar, of wonderful devotees from Bangalore temple which is ruled by
president Madhu Pandit Das. This temple is located in India and is
believed to be the biggest and most beautiful temples of ISKCON in the
world. It is also known as Hill of Hare Krishna where five temples, with
the installed deities of Lord Krishna, are situated: Sri Sri
Radha-Krishnachandra, Sri Sri Krishna-Balarama, Sri Sri Nitay-Gauranga,
Sri-Narasimha and Sri Srinivasa-Givinda. The temple was constructed upon
the project of Madhu Pandit Das together with Jagat Chandra Das, the
Bombay Institute of Information and Technology graduates. In this
project they managed to fuse elements of traditional south Indian and
modern architectural styles.

Temple complex is equipped with different facilities allowing to
introduce visitors with the cultural and spiritual message of Lord
Krishna and His pure devotee His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada
the acharya-founder and spiritual master of ISKCON. The
construction of the temple was sponsored by 25000 Bangalorian donators.
On every birthday each of them is invited with the whole family to the
temple where priests held a special puja for the Lord on their name.

The temple complex was solemnly opened by the president of India Shri
Shaker Dil Sharma in may 1997. From the very opening this temple has
accepted |SP| as a *diksha-guru* and since then is acting in
accurate accordance with his instructions. Fulfilling their devotional
service with sincere love devotees well realize that they are disciples
of |HDGSP|. Accepting a bona fide spiritual
master became a great stimulus in their spiritual life and preaching.

This success in their preaching activities became possible as a result
of reorganization which took place after devotees no more considered
themselves a part of empire of His Holiness Jayapataka Svami and
returned to |SP| family. Since then the amount of books
spread is increasing in blasting tempo. Devotees realized that main
stimulus in preaching for them is the awareness of |SP| as
their *diksha-guru* and that now on they shell not be satisfied with
cheap substitutes. For example, they have told how they used to be in
illusion of obeying a “guru” Jayapataka Svami and how difficult it was
to get enthusiasm to spread books of |SP| while listening to
the teachings of Jayapataka Svami.

Now everything is in order. They are devoted to |SP|, they
clearly see and realize their aim and this pushes them to spread books
of |SP| their real guru. By the grace of |SP|
this temple held’s first place in the world in spreading His books. The
best spreaders of books live in Bangalor temple. Unfortunately in other
temples where the atmosphere is of pseudo ISKCON gurus is prevailing
devotees stopped paying serious attention to such an important form of
preaching.

Bhakta-das many times had a chance to stay at this wonderful temple for
few days. Every time he used to come there he could see how devotees
serve |SP| and Krishna with great enthusiasm and true love.
In this temple devotees live as a one big family just the way |SP|
wanted it. Senior devotees with much attention and love show
their care to junior ones helping them in their devotional service to
Krishna. And they in turn showing respect to elders rely on them in
every way.

Such cooperation based on love and mutual respect makes devotional
service perfect. And this promotes quick spiritual growth. Due to such
a, Vaikuntha like, spiritual atmosphere in this wonderful temple, every
devotee has a real Brahmanic qualities. With their sincere and loving
service they make this temple even more wonderful. It’s amazing to see
how in the whole temple there prevails peace and welfare. And with no
doubt great merit in it belongs to the president of this temple Madhu
Pandit Prabhu.

When Bhakta das was taking prasad together with other devotees he didn’t
just enjoy Krishna-prasadam but more over seeing devotees showing so
much of loving care to each other while serving it. Bhakta das was very
much pleased associating with such a high devotees and his heart was
filled with indescribable bliss.

As we began to talk about prasad we’d like to say few words about it
because *It’s a very important matter.* Prasadam in this temple is so
delicious not just because it was cooked with so much of love and
devotion but also because it was offered to God in accordance with all
the rules described in |SP| books, such as: devotee offers
it with love and devotion chanting pranama to |SP| and the
whole parampara up to the Lord Krishna. This kind of prasadam offered in
correct way, with love and devotion is accepted by Lord Krishna with
delight. Krishna says that he partakes prasad with the mouths of his
pure devotees. That’s why this prasad blessed by Lord is sooo delicious
that makes you “fly” in ecstasy.

Those devotees who worship self-appointed gurus of ISKCON when offering
food chant pranama to their “guru” in first place, the guru who is not
pure devotee and does not stand in the disciplic succession, and then
offer it to |SP| and parmapara. In this way they insult
lotus feet of |SP| and whole parampara. This kind of food is
not accepted by Krishna.

Real prasad is not different from Lord Krishna and is pure, blessed by
Lord and is full of divine energy. When person takes such a prasad
enriched with divine energy he is set free from his sins and receives
spiritual enlightenment. But from so called “prasad” offered to such a
“guru” person receives no boon except that he simply eats vegetarian
food.

This temple was visited by many devotees from different countries
including Russia. And we have heard from them many nice words about this
temple and its wonderful devotees.

Thousands of guests come to this Temple every day and each visitor
receives a free cup of kitchri cooked of rise and dal. It’s a humble
effort of domestic devotees to fulfill |SP|'s desire which He
once expressed in 1974: *“God is a father and where there is father
there is no hunger… Nobody in 10 miles radius around temple should be
hungry*\ ”.

Kitchens of the temple are equipped with modern facilities which allow
to quickly cook a lot of *prasad* and feed up to two thousand people
every hour. During three years around 750 ton of *prasad* has been
distributed. In addition to free *prasad* there are various dishes
cooked at the kitchen which after being offered to God on the altar
appear on the counter where all guests can buy them at *cost price.*

The service provided to the guests by the temple stuff is always on the
highest level. Thanks to the experienced and talented manager and
preacher Madhu Pandit Prabhu this temple functions as a huge well tuned
mechanism where each of five hundred members of the stuff has his
special role. Madhu Pandit Prabhu also pays attention to protection of
the cows. In the *goshal*\ of the temple there are held forty cows,
their milk is used for cooking special dishes for the deities. Temple
has its own farm of 40 hectares close to Misora on the Kaveri river
bank. Here grains, vegetables and fruits are grown without any chemical
fertilizers. All the products growing there are sold in a store named
“Dharani” located in the Bangalore temple complex.

Within few first years of its existence this temple has achieved a huge
success in preaching Krishna Consciousness and acquired great respect
among Indian leaders. This temple is supported by Indian government.
Devotees guided by Madhu Pandit prabhu carry out huge programs
distributing *prasad*. This program includes distribution of ISKCON
temple lunches to the pupils of the government schools in Bangalor and
its suburbs.

Regarding this case the prime minister of India Mr. Atal Bihari Vaidjpee
has sent personal message to Madhu Pandit Prabhu expressing his
gratitude:

“I’m happy to learn that Bangalorian branch of International Society of
Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) has come forward with the initiative of
conducting an “Akshaia Patra” program, which includes distribution of
lunches to the government schools students in the country areas of
Karnataka. The scale of this program, involving daily supplies of
nutritious food made of rise, paneer and vegetables to 30.000 students
is very impressing. This is a service to God as well as nation.
Insufficient nutrition among the children from poor families badly
affects their attendance of the school, health and whole their future
adult life. And this is not just their personal loss: it’s a loss for
the whole nation and humanity…”

By now up to hundred thousand of children everyday receive nutritious
lunches of rise with vegetables and paneer - blessed by Lord Krishna. In
this way the whole generation of students will grow eating mainly
*Krishna-prasad*. No doubt that their relatives will appreciate this
help and thus will become more opened to accept the philosophy of
Krishna consciousness.

So, gradually the whole area will become “Krishnanized”! It’s a real
mini revolution in the field of preaching.

Madhu Pandit prabhu has declared that this is not just a charity but
also the fulfillment of |SP|’s plan - to conquer the whole
world. This program was encouraged by the following letter of |SP|:

“At a moment I’m especially concerned with distributing round India
grain, rice, wheat, cooked as dal and rise Prasad. People here are much
agitated because of, partly punishment of the Nature itself, partly for
the reason of wrong management of the demonic governors, they do not
have food. And if people do not have sufficient food they are not able
to perceive the spiritual knowledge. Therefore I hope, if we start
widely distributing free food to people in India, right in our centre’s
as well as traveling in the villages, we will conquer whole country and
whole world with this activity in the name of Krishna.”

(Letter to Satyahita 16.03.74)

And |SP|’s plan is working!

Madhu Pandit prabhu has said that this program phenomenally insinuates
ISKCON into people’s confidence. So, this program is a next step in the
mission of - REVIVING ISKCON and making it in accurate accordance with
|SP|s instructions. And only in this way, ONLY accurately
following |SP|s instructions, we CAN “conquer whole country
and world with our activities in the name of Krishna.”

There has been finished the construction of the temple complex in
Vrindavan held under the Madhu Pandit prabhu’s project. They plan,
similar to Bangalore, grandiose program of distributing prasad to the
children in Vrindavan government schools. Devotees plan to start with
twenty five thousand portions and with the time feed up to hundred
thousand children daily in Vrindavan, Madhura and their suburbs.

One program like this costs temple more than 300 thousand dollars a
month and temple has no financial problems. It looks as if Lashmi
herself, the goddess of prosperity, is trying to serve such pure
devotees. Very soon whole world will discuss pure devotees of
Bangalorian temple who act for the good of the humanity. They do best
charity for the world, distributing Krishna consciousness in form of
Krishna-prasadam, which is not different from Krishna himself, books of
Krishna and preaching Krishna consciousness. This is the real Society of
Krishna consciousness, that very Society which |SP| wanted
to see. This temple is an EXAMPLE of global importance for all of us.

We would like that as much devotees as possible would know about this
temple and its wonderful devotees who have accepted |SP| as
a **bona fide** diksha-guru with their whole hearts and act according
with His will. We should follow their example, we are all brothers and
sisters of one big family. There should be no conflicts and
disagreements between us, like: “This is my Godbrother and this is not
my Godbrother.” This can lead to the split of our Society. |SP| 
is a – Bona fide Spiritual Master for *all of us*. So let’s
unify into one big family, as it was settled by |SP|,
creating a spirit of unity, brotherhood and cooperation.

The most urgent question
============================================================================

Once there came to visit the Namohata-centre a senior devotee
(*brahman*) and we had very vivid conversation discussing “\ *Who is a
bona fide diksha-guru for us in ISKCON*?” After a short while it became
clear that this brahman persistently stays on the concept of embodied
(physically present) *diksha-guru*\ on the planet\ *,* reasoning that in
*Vaiṣṇava*\ tradition when guru leaves the planet his disciples can
*occupy His place* and become a *diksha-guru.*\ Bring to notice – this
place is presently occupied by *eighty “gurus”* and each of them is a
“representative” of Krishna. And such a “representative” is elected by
GBC voting. This system is invention of GBC itself. *|SP|
says*:

“Guru is self-manifested and there is no need to chose Him” “Tradition –
it’s all material. Our only tradition is how to satisfy Vishnu."

(|SP|, lecture on B.g. 30.07.1973 London)

**“…The guru is one because he comes in disciplic succession. [ ]The
real guru cannot be two, for the real guru does not speak differently
from his predecessors.**\ ” ("Science of self realization" ch. 2).

"So we should associate by the vibration, and not by the physical
presence. That is real association."

(|SP|, lecture 18.08. 1968 Montreal)

**"Just Krishna can be present simultaneously in millions of places.
Smililarly, the spiritual master can be present wherever the disciple
wants.**\ **A spiritual master is the principle, not the body.**\ **"**

(Letter from |SP| to Malati 28.05.1968)

This brahman went on defending his false position of unauthorized ISKCON
gurus regardless any arguments and even last will of |SP|
(see appendix) from (09.07. 1977) where Prabhupada explains what kind of
initiation system should be maintained after His departure. In spite of
his academic education this brahman was deluded and baffled with this
distorted philosophy of pseudo gurus. Abiding in illusions he fails to
understand from whom do we receive the transcendental knowledge – a
*divya-jnana* and who is our **bona fide** *diksha-guru*. Each of us
knows these words well:

*chakhu-dan dilo jei, janme janme prabhu sei:*

"**He opens my darkened eyes and fills my heart with transcendental
knowledge. He is my Lord birth after birth.**"

*But do we really all ponder upon these words?* Many of us consider that
ceremony of initiation, which we pass through during fire *yagna*, to be
that very *diksha-initiation,*\ which we have heard about so many times.
Many self-appointed gurus come and go and we are left with our broken
spiritual lives. And devotee, feeling great difficulties, is facing a
choice of spiritual master once again. This looks like game of tape
measure, where the rate is our spiritual life.

*|SP| says*: **"We must choose great person – Maha-jnani -
and follow him, otherwise we will be taught here and there and lose our
time in vain".**

This is what is actually happening now. We get initiation from one
unauthorized guru and after his fall (spiritual degradation) get
"reinitiation" from another and consider this to be okay and think we
are on right path. This is all - an *illusion*. If there was no
initiation in our heart, in other words, if we have not received
transcendental knowledge (*divya-jnana*) from a **bona fide** spiritual
master, who at the present moment is |SP|, then all these
rites of initiation and "reinitiation", shall we pass them more than
ten, will bring us no result.

*|SP| says*: **"Well, initiation or no initiation, first
thing is knowledge... knowledge. Initiation is formality. Just like you
go to a school for knowledge, and admission is formality. That is not
very important thing."**

(Interview with |SP| 16.10.76 Chandigarh)

"Initiation is a formality. First of all you have to decide whether you
will abide by the rules and regulations and become Krsna conscious. That
is your consideration. You have to decide for yourself whether you are
going to take this Krsna consciousness seriously. That is your decision.
Initiation is a formality. If you are serious, that is real initiation.
If you have understood this Krsna philosophy and if you have decided
that you will take Krsna consciousness seriously and preach the
philosophy to others, that is your initiation. My touch is simply a
formality. It is your determination. That is initiation.”

(|SP| conversation, 'The Search for the Divine', Back to
Godhead, # 49)

**Devotee:** How important is formal initiation?

**|SP|**: Formal initiation means to officially agree to
follow the instructions of Krishna and His representative. (|SP|, lecture, 22.2.73 Oakland).

Please note, |SP| always speaks of a guru or about
representative of Shri Krishna in singular, since **bona fide** guru or
representative of Krishna is ONE. |SP| in his preaching
often used words "bona fide". He says: "Unfortunately, at the present
moment there are many pseudo gurus; therefore we have to add this word
"bona fide". Otherwise the word "guru" means "bona fide", because one
who is not "bona fide" cannot be a guru". (Dialectical spiritualism).
Thus |SP| paid to these words such an importance in order to
make us remember his instruction in the future and avoid the deceit.
However by the will of the fate many of devotees are caught up in this
fraud.

For instance: those first Russian devotees sincerely dedicated to |SP|
in the beginning had a big progress in their spiritual lives.
Some of them bared even severe punishment from demonic government for
their sincere wish to serve Krishna and His Representative. But from the
moment they have stopped to chante *pranama* to |SP| and
sincerely serve Him, accepting protection of unauthorized gurus the flow
of Grace from |SP| discontinued. Thereafter they remained at
a level of realization of their spiritual adolescence even regardless
their “brahmanic” initiations and seemingly "wide knowledge" in the
field of philosophy. It is said in Padma Purana:

   *sampradaya-vihina ye*

   *mantras te nisphala matah*

"Unless you are initiated by a **bona fide** spiritual master *in the
disciplic succession, the\ *\ **mantra**\ that you might have received
**is without any effect.**"

"On the other hand, one who has received the transcendental knowledge by
**aural**\ reception from the *bona fide preceptor in the disciplic
chain*, and who has sincere regard for the *real acarya*, *must needs be
enlightened with the revealed knowledge of the Vedas*. **But this
knowledge is permanently sealed to the cognitive approach of the
empiricists**."

(“Science of Self-Realization”gl. 2)

Spiritual Master should be capable to bring his disciple back home to
God. For this he must be a self-realized soul. The self-realized soul is
always liberated.

“Vishvanatha Chakravarti says: “\ *kintu prabhor yah priya eva
tasya.*\ Because he is the mostconfidentialservitor of God, the guru is
offered the same respect that we offer God. **God is always God, guru
is**\ **always**\ **guru**. As a matter of etiquette, God is the
worshipable God, and guru is the worshiper God (sevaka-bhagavan).
Therefore the guru is addressed as *prabhupada*. The word prabhu means
"lord," and pada means "position." Thus *prabhupada* means "he who has
taken the position of the Lord." This is the same as *saksad-dharitvena
samasta-sastraih*.”

(“Science of Self-Realization”gl. 2)

Guru who knows the truth - is one who SEES the truth. It never happens
that one was not a guru, did not see the truth and suddenly one
**recovered one’s sight** and "saw" the truth or “behold” the truth and
became a "bona fide “guru". Only a guru cheater can declare so. Of cause
devotee may reach such a high level of realization to see *paramatma* in
oneself. However it does not give him right to be a *diksha-guru.* He
cannot become "Prabhupada" on his own whimsy. **Bona fide** guru should
be from Goloka or receive special authorization from preceding acharya.
When Krishna or Lord Caitanya appeared in this world they were God from
very moment of their appearance. God is always God. Similarly when |SP|
appeared into this world He also was a guru since the moment
of his appearance and when the time came He manifested as a **bona
fide** guru. Guru is self manifested. Guru is *always* guru. Spiritual
master is *always* liberated. But how can conditioned soul give
liberation to his disciple? We in our ignorance change one conditioned
guru for another and herewith hope to return to spiritual world. This
"reinitiated" *brahman* was much offended and confessed that his false
EGO was badly touched. He left saying that we have no humility.

*In this kali-yuga – hypocrisy is taken for humility and those who speak
the truth are considered offenders.*

This is how this material world of this *Kali age* is – people are more
pleased to hear the sweet lie rather than truth. In none of the |SP|
books shall we find explanation of what is "reinitiation"
because to His disciples, that is to say to us, this term has nothing to
do. Listening to the interpreted philosophy of unauthorized gurus
majority of devotees do not know or understand in a wrong way what
*diksha*\ is? Who is a **bona fide** *diksha-guru*? What qualities
*diksha-guru* should possess? From whom do we receive the *divya-jnana*?
How the process of *initiation* occurs? This complex subject has never
been discussed on ISKCON “guru” lectures and for many years remained
closed for us. In this book you shall find answers to all of these
urgent questions. For an example we shall tell you how, where and under
which circumstances Bhakta-das did receive initiation from |SP|.

The great luck
============================================================================

Every person is eager to find happiness in this material world and with
all power strives for it. In his essential nature living being is
*sat-chit-ananda* full of eternity, knowledge and bliss, that’s why he
naturally wants and strives to find this happiness. In quest of
voluptuous enjoyment living being chases after it around the universe,
as a mirage in a desert, changing one body for another, one planet for
another. However, in whatever human body we are and whatever planet we
accommodate it makes no difference – as we are still in the prison of
the material world. Is it really possible to be happy in prison?

*|SP| says*: "We have given up the company of God to come to
this material world to enjoy ourselves. So God has allowed us to come
here, saying: "All right, enjoy this experience, and when you understand
that this material enjoyment is ultimately frustrating, you can come
back". Thus the Supreme Lord is guiding the enjoyment of all living
beings, especially human beings, so that they may again return home,
back to Godhead". (“Dialectical spiritualism”).

If we have been lucky enough to meet in this lifetime a spiritual master
- this is great luck and true happiness.

“Any person who is seriously desirous of achieving real happiness must
accept a **bona fide** spiritual master and take shelter in him by
initiation.” (Dialectical spiritualism)

Accepting a **bona fide** spiritual master is a very important event in
the life of the person.

After many and many pious births Lord himself comes to such a person in
the image of the spiritual master. It is said about him that he is a
very lucky soul.

   *om ajnana-timirandasya jnananjnana salakaya*

   *caksur unmilitam yena tasmai sri gurave namah*

**"I offer my most humble obeisances to my spiritual master who has
opened my eyes which were blinded by ignorance with the light of
knowledge."**

In this chapter Bhakta das opens his heart to the readers and says:

"My spiritual master rescued me from hell and more... I am deeply in his
debt and it cannot be repaid.

My dear gurudev Prabhupada, I am unable to repay you for what you have
done for me. By shedding unconditional mercy you have gifted me with
holy name of the Lord. Even if I give you my life it will still be not
enough. My life costs nothing. It’s like a drop in the ocean compared
with what I owe you. Therefore, I shall give you my sincerity which is
more valuable than my life. Beside that I have nothing".

*In November 1991 Bhakta-das received first initiation (hari-nama
diksha) from His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada. From
December 1991 up to December 1995 he lived and was occupied with
devotional service in Moscow “Begovaia” temple. In September 1994 he
passed through the*\ **ceremony**\ *of initiation (fire yajna) and got
spiritual name from Niranjana Svami. From the end of 1995 till year 2000
he lived in Sri Mayapura dhama. He was spreading books of |SP|
in Mayapur, Vrindavan, Calcutta, Delhi and other cities of India.*

In beginning of October 1991 Bhakta-das purchased a book of 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada "Bhagavad-gītā as it is" and after some
time began to read it. Having examined the illustrations in first hand
he found the book to be very valuable. He was reading it one day,
another, a week but understood nothing. He started reading it again and
again he could understand nothing. "Am I really so stupid?" he thought
and he felt so offended and shameful for himself that tears filled his
eyes. And then he prayed to the Lord asking for help. He prayed so
intensely and sincerely that it turned into weeping as if he were
entreating Him for life. When he calmed down he proceeded once again to
reading and, strange to say, gradually started understanding. Reading
and rereading shlokas, sometimes two-three times, Bhakta-das gradually
moved forward stopping and pondering over each verse. And he was so
excited with reading that he simply forgot the meal.

After few days of such a self-improvement, Bhakta-das’s brains begun to
stir from overstrain, in the ordinary sense of the word. He had such a
sensation as if there in his brain a kind of replacement was going on.
This caused him strong pain. After some time the pain gradually started
remitting and soon totally vanished. As he continued to read, Bhakta-das
started noticing that he can hear the voice, which we can say dictated
him what he read with the eyes and this voice directly penetrated his
heart. He has no words to describe his condition that time, but as he
says, in that moment he failed to understand what was going on - "where
he was or who he was". He kind of lost ability to feel the surrounding
reality and was in the state of prostration. And so it was day after
day. Bhakta-das fully sunk in "Bhagavad-gītā" and does not remember how
many days he spent fasting like that, possibly 5 or 7.

It was morning, sitting on the bed and facing the window Bhakta-das was
reading "Bhagavad-gītā" somewhere in the end of the fourth chapter.
Reading and listening to the same voice on some moment he clearly
realized how much sinful he was, what a rascal he was, his lifestyle was
leading him directly to the hell. Bhakta-das had his tears running, sobs
shook whole body and he caught his breath. Having lost his consciousness
he fell flat on the back. All this happened instantly. When Bhakta-das
regained consciousness he took up Bhagavad-gītā from the floor and
opened it, where Hare Krishna maha-mantra was written. He wrote it down
on the piece of paper and started repeating holy name of the Lord:

   Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare,

   Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

**"The spiritual master, by his words, can penetrate into the heart of
the suffering person and inject knowledge transcendental, which alone
can extinguish the fire of material existence."**

(Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 1.7.22, commentary).

From that moment he surrendered and accepted |SP| as his
spiritual master. He started following all adjusting principles:
chanting Hare Krishna *maha-mantra*\ sixteen rounds daily; worshiping
the Supreme Lord, with great respect; following the instructions of
|SP| which he got *through his books* and offering Him food
prepared with love. This is how his devotional service began. *This is
what was an initiation*\ receivedfrom |SP|.

**"Initiation - is a formality. If you are serious then this is
your**\ **true**\ **initiation. My touch is a simple formality. Your
determination,**\ **this**\ **is what an initiation is".**

(Journal "Search for the Divine”).

**"As far as the time
of**\ `diksa <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/d/diksa>`__\ **(initiation)
is concerned, everything depends on the position of
the**\ `guru <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/g/guru>`__\ **. [ ] If by
chance one gets
a**\ `sad <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/s/sad>`__\ **-**\ `guru <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/g/guru>`__\ **,
it doesn't matter whether one is in the temple or the forest. If
the**\ `sad <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/s/sad>`__\ **-**\ `guru <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/g/guru>`__\ **,
the bona fide spiritual master, agrees, one can be initiated
immediately, without waiting for a suitable time or place."** (C.C
Madhya 24.331, commentary).

Being a *sad-guru*\ **bona fide** spiritual master and occupying unique
position |SP| can initiate anyone regardless time, place and
circumstances by means of His books, into which he has put his consent
(siddha mantra).

In conclusion Bhakta-das opens to us his small secret. A great luck came
to him to actually see |SP| in the summer of 1971 in Moscow
on the Red square, opposite to the St. Basil's Cathedral. Prabhupada
stood with small group of the people (two - three) and as Bhakta-das had
understood they were going to make photos. Passing by with his friends
he paid attention to Him and even stopped for a while since Prabhupada
attracted him with His unusual look. He mechanically made few steps
towards them to see Him better. Amongst young people Prabhupada seemed
to be very small and outstanding in his strange dressing as it seemed to
him that time. He wore a small pink-orange hat on his head. In his
right-hand he held a walking stick with curly handle and was exchanging
remarks with these young people. And herewith His movements and bearing
were so amazingly unusual that it made Bhakta-das to smile. He smiled
and thought – “what an interesting Hindu” and as he noticed Prabhupada
too in this moment threw His merciful glance at him. This is how he got
a drop of nectar from |SP|. Unfortunately that time
Bhakta-das could not recognize Him as *sadhu* and very soon forgot about
this meeting. However twenty years later in the temple he saw photo of
|SP| with background of the St. Basil's Cathedral and he
immediately recalled this amazing meeting. And once again he experienced
these unusual feelings to this person.

"Out of many millions of wandering living entities, one who is very
fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a **bona fide**
spiritual master by the grace of Krsna. By the mercy of both Krsna and
the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of
devotional service." (C.C. Madhya 19.151).

*|SP| says*: **"Even an instant contact with pure devotee
brings absolute success!"**

(Conversation with |SP|, 13.12.70)

This is really true and Bhakt-das had a great luck to experience it.
Twenty years after this meeting in 1991 he got first initiation from
|SP|, as it was described above. Аnd in 2005 staying in
India in Bangalore ISKCON temple of Sri Sri Radha-Krishnachandra on a
day of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati appearance he got his second
*diksha-initiation*\ from |SP|. And only now after more than
thirty years from the first meeting with |SP|, which was
possible only through His unconditional mercy, Bhakta-das is able to see
a **bona fide** *sadhu*\ in Him. As a matter of fact we all had *great
luck* to meet this\ *greatest* personality on our life journey. Each of
us has a possibility to communicate with such a pure devotee as |SP|
and receive His mercy. It all depends on our desire and our
choice. If we accept |SP| as a **bona
fide**\ *\ guru,*\ leave aside *all false* and place Him in our heart we
shall never part from Him and will *ALWAYS* communicate!

"So we should associate by the vibration, **and not by the physical
presence**. That is real association."

(|SP|, lecture 18.08.68 Montreal)

The highest truth
============================================================================

**“Therefore, if the Absolute Truth is one, about which we think there
is no difference of opinion, the guru also cannot be**\ **two**\ **."**

**"The guru is**\ **one**\ **because he comes in disciplic
succession."**

("Science of Self-Realization" ch. 2)

*|SP| says:* "Since human reason is not perfect, revelation
is also needed. The truth is attained through logic, philosophy and
revelation. According to Vaiṣṇava philosophy we arrived at the truth
through the guru, the spiritual master, who is *accepted as a
representative* of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. He
transmits the message of the truth because *he sees* the Absolute Truth
through the disciplic succession. If we accept the bona fide spiritual
master and please him by submissive service, by virtue of His mercy and
pleasure, we can understand God and the spiritual world by revelation.
We therefore offer our respects to the spiritual master in the prayer:

   *yasya prasadayd bhagavat-prasado*

   *yasyaprasadam no gatih kuto pi*

   *dhyayan stuvams tasya yasas tri-sandhyam*

   *vande guroh sri-caranaravindam*

“By the mercy of the spiritual master, one receives the benediction of
Krsna. Without the grace of the spiritual master, one cannot make any
advancement. Therefore, I should always remember and praise the
spiritual master, offering respectful obeisances unto his lotus feet at
least three times a day.” (Sri Sri Guru-astaka 8). We can understand God
if we please the spiritual master, who carries the Lord’s message
without speculation. It is said: *sevoyamukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva
sphuraty adah (Padma Purana)* When we engage our senses in the Lord’s
service, the Lord is revealed.

(Dialectical Spiritualism)

We shell hope that all of us understand well what kind of spiritual
master is discussed in this verse.

|SP| – is such a personality for us.

"Bhagavad-gītā" Verse 4. 34, Krishna says:

   *tad viddhi pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya*

   *upadeksyanti te jnanam jnaninas tattva-darsinah*

**"Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.
Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The
self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the
truth."**

(The Authentic text B.g.4.34. 1972)

We have read this verse many times but hardly ever tried to understand
the true meaning of it. Thoroughly studying this utterance we would
understand that **bona fide**\ *\ guru*\ is **ONE**.

According to Bhagavad-gītā itself we must come to a *bona fideguru*\ who
**sees the truth**.

This verse with the commentary is especially important, or you may say,
is the key verse of the whole "Bhagavad-gītā". Without due understanding
of this verse it’s practically impossible to reach the spiritual
perfection. Bhagavad-gītā is a direct revelation of God and if we try to
understand it we can realize God. In this verse Krishna advises us to
address a **bona fide**\ spiritual master, who belongs to the chain of
disciplic succession, starting from Lord Himself. Nobody can be a **bona
fide**\ spiritual master if he does not belong to such a succession.
Lord Krishna tells us what qualities should spiritual master have. He
calls him a self-realized soul. Self-realized soul – is ever liberated
soul and he *comes to us from spiritual world* to rescue the fallen
conditioned souls. And only such a personality can be a **bona
fide**\ spiritual master. Krishna speaks of spiritual master in
singular. This signifies that **bona fide**\ *\ guru*– is ONE, there
cannot be two **bona fide** gurus. Guru who knows the truth – is one
**who sees** the TRUTH.

Further in the commentary |SP| explains how the process of
transaction of the transcendental knowledge or *initiation takes place*
and what qualities disciple should have. He must *completely hand
oneself over* to Him (|SP|), become His lowermost servant
and humbly\ *inquire* Him forgetting about one’s false pride. If
disciple doesn’t have such qualities he will not be able to perceive the
transcendental knowledge (*divya-jnana*).

"Inquiry" is needed for the disciple to perceive the knowledge. There is
no references proving that "inquiry", devotional service and "control of
disciple" requires direct physical contact with the guru. In the
commentary to the verse 4.34 of Bhagavad-gītā |SP| speaks of
these as essential actions for the disciple. "Control" simply means that
*disciple agrees to follow the adjusting principles* and that’s why it
can be carried out through representatives of the guru.

**"In this way the disciple renders devotional service under the
guidance of the spiritual master or**\ **his representative**\ **".**

(C.C., Madhya, 24.330)

**"This is the process of initiation.**\ **The disciple must
vow**\ **that he will no longer commit sinful activity [...] He promises
to execute the order of the spiritual master.**\ **Then**\ **the
spiritual master takes care of him and elevates him to spiritual
emancipation".**

(C.C., Madhiya, 24.256)

Thereby |SP| by means of His books, into which He has
*enclosed* his consent (*siddha mantra*), is ready to accept everyone as
His disciple. We should really want to receive transcendental knowledge
(initiation) from Him and then our life would become successful. What
has happened to Bhakta-das completely corresponds with this verse. The
transaction of transcendental knowledge from the teacher to disciple –
is a "mystical" process and it does not require physical contact. No
material barriers can hinder transaction of this knowledge.

If person reading books of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada accepts
transcendental knowledge and sincerely surrenders to this process – that
becomes his initiation. All who are sincerely attracted to this
Saṅkīrtana movement are actually initiated by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada
even though, unfortunately, not everyone realizes it.

Our material feelings are covered with material mind and they are both
contaminated. Until we clean our mind and intellect from material filth
we shall not have true spiritual realization which gives us possibility
to *listen* to Krishna just like Arjuna did on the field of the
Kurukshetra battle.

**The influence of a pure devotee is such that if someone comes to
associate with him with a little faith, one gets the chance
of**\ **hearing**\ **about the Lord from**\ **authoritative
scriptures**\ **like Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad Bhāgavatam.... This is the
first stage of association with pure devotee."**

("Nectar to Devotion" ch.19)

The contact with spiritual master |SP|, the direct
representative of Supreme Personality of Godhead is established from the
first day when disciple starts *HEARING* Him. Everyone has a possibility
to *communicate* with |SP| *through His books* but very few
have even small faith on Him. This is the reason for our deafness.

*|SP| says:*\ **"These are not ordinary books. It is
recorded chanting. ANYONE WHO READS, HE IS HEARING.**" (Letter of |SP| to Rupanuga 19.10. 74)

Only our faith in |SP| and full surrender to Him will give
us possibility to hear this *recorded chanting.* But without faith in
our *acharya* we shall not be able to correctly perceive the philosophy
given in His books.

*|SP| says*: "**Try to understand**\ **philosophy given in
my books**".

Indian lady\ **:** **Is that spiritual master still guiding after the
death?**

*|SP|*: **yes, yes. Just like Krishna is guiding us,
similarly, spiritual master will guide.**

(|SP|, lecture 23.09.1969)

Further in Bhagavad-gītā verse 4.35. Krishna says:

..

   *yaj*\ `jnatva <http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/j/jnatva>`__\ `na <http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/n/na>`__\ `punar <http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/p/punar>`__\ `moham <http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/m/moham>`__\ `evam <http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/e/evam>`__\ `yasyasi <http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/y/yasyasi>`__\ `pandava <http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/p/pandava>`__

   `yena <http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/y/yena>`__\ *bhutany*\ `aseshani <http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/a/asesani>`__\ *drakshyasy
   atmany*\ `atho <http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/a/atho>`__\ `mayi <http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/m/mayi>`__

**“Having obtained real knowledge from a self-realized soul, you will
never fall again into such illusion, for by this knowledge you will see
that all living beings are but part of the Supreme, or, in other words,
that they are Mine”.**

In other words, having received an initiated from the *bona fide*
spiritual master you shall never go back to material lifestyle, since
having true knowledge embedded in your heart you will not be baffled by
the illusory energy of the Lord. If person perceived transcendental
knowledge from the *bona fide* guru he naturally surrenders to Him and
is gradually freed from the power of Maya (illusion). Nobody is able to
lead astray the one who got knowledge through revelation.

In this verse Krishna emphasizes the importance of reception of the true
knowledge from self realized souls, *direct representative of the
disciplic succession.* Sri Krishna and His representative are not
different from each other. To have initiation from |SP| who
is pure medium between God and us – is same as to get the initiation
from Krishna himself like Ardjuna did in his time. And this is a fact!
Such a sincere devotee is protected by Krishna from dawn fall. From
these verses it becomes clear that only His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada
can occupy the position of a *diksha-guru*.

In (Mundaka Upanishad 1.2.12) it is said:

   *tad-vijnanartham sa gurum evabhigacchet*

   *samit-panih srotriyam brahma-nistham*

"The Vedas enjoin us to **accept** a guru; actually, they say to
**accept** the guru, not just a guru. **The guru is one because he comes
in disciplic succession**. What Vyāsadeva and Krsna taught five thousand
years ago is also being taught now. There is no difference between the
two instructions. Although hundreds and thousands of acaryas have come
and gone, the message is one\ **. The real guru cannot be two**\ **, for
the real guru does not speak differently from his predecessors.**"

("Science of the self realization" ch. 2)

Here we see this verse unchanged, however in the book "Science of the
self realization" 1991 (chapter 2, Choice of the spiritual teacher),
this verse is changed. In this verse word "to accept" was changed for
the words "to seek out". The Sanskrit word "*evabhigacchet* " means – to
address or to accept, but never "seek out", thereby "*sa gurum
evabhigacchet* " means – to accept a guru. These books did not manifest
themselves, they were written by acharya |SP| - *direct*
representative of Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently, when
person takes into hand these books, reads shlokas and commentary to
them, he has *already "found"* a very certain guru. It’s not a matter of
"seeking out" but a matter of acceptance. If person accepts this
knowledge he accepts it from that person, who by means of His books
gives transcendental knowledge (*divya-jnana*). This is what is called
initiation. Such a person is a **bona fide**\ *\ diksha-guru*\ for us
and from that moment spiritual connection is established between us.

*|SP| says:*"*Eternal bond* between disciple and Spiritual
Master begins from the first day he *HEARS*."

(Letter from |SP| to Jadurani, 4.09.72)

In order to hide the illegal position of *diksha-*\ gurus, leaders of
GBC have made changes in all the books of |SP| wherever it
is concerned the *diksha-guru*\ matter. Leaders of GBC are committing a
great sin trying to delude the unsophisticated people. They have used
word "*seek out*" only because there are already more than eighty
unauthorized gurus. And as *they consider,* person should "seek out" for
himself a "*LIVING"* guru amongst these 80-ty as per his taste. It’s
just like person choosing natural ("LIVING") flowers. This is absolute
MAYA! And those, preaching such a "*system of multiple acharyas*" and
encourage unsophisticated people to "seek out" a "*LIVING*" guru are in
*deep* ILLUSION themselves. They have not taken into account the fact
that thereinafter in this verse |SP| says:

"**Guru is**\ **one**\ **since he comes in the chain of disciplic
succession".**

What to *seek* for, if **bona fide**\ *\ guru*\ is ONE? Guru is not
chosen! We\ *find* guru by the grace of Krishna and find Krishna by the
grace of guru. The Supreme Lord abides in the hearts of everyone and
directs the wanderings of all conditioned souls. If person sincerely
wants a **bona fide**\ guru, Krishna directs him to **bona fide**\ guru
and if person is not sincere and wants to be defrauded Krishna directs
him to false guru. However under the influence of illusion such a person
thinks that this pseudo guru – is true. But this is not truth. The Truth
is ONE and there cannot be two truths, not eighty, more so. What is at
the present taken as the truth is called MAYA.

*|SP| says*: "If you *want a* cheap guru, or if you want to
be cheated, then you will find\ *many* cheating *gurus*. But if you are
*sincere,* you will find a *sincere guru*."

(Science of the self-realization ch. 2)

For us it is still not comprehensible why people sinking in the ocean of
material existence allow these cheaters to defraud them, but may be they
want to be defrauded themselves? Is it a trick of Maya or their own
desire?

There are enough of books to understand ― only |SP|, being
the\ *direct representative*\ of Supreme Personality of Godhead, can be
a **bona fide**\ *\ diksha-guru*. Being *tree-kala-gya* |SP|
foresaw what would happen after His death and He took care to leave us a
document: "*Declaration of Will from 04.06*.\ *1977*" and "*Last Order
from 09.07.1977*" where |SP| describes himself how the
Worldwide Society "ISKCON" should function and how initiation should be
performed after His departure. But despite all this, there were
"*SUCH..."* people who so cunningly deluded thousands and thousands of
devotees. Diksha-guru should be a realized person - the *siddha-purusha*
of the mantra which he gives. It’s amazing, that during all these years
we devotees never assigned a question: Why there are so many
*diksha-gurus*? Are they ALL *siddha-purushas*? *Maha-bhagavatas*?
Representatives of Krishna? Will each of them *bring us to the spiritual
world*? And if not! Then why is *such* *guru* needed? "Simple fashion?"
as |SP| says. By the way, let us say few words on fashion.
Nowadays it’s very much in fashion to become a guru: prestige, glory,
mastery and money! Nice "guru-business".

"**One should understand the spiritual master to be as good as I am,"
said the Blessed Lord**."

(The science of self-realization, ch.2)

With every year there appear more and more people wishing to trying the
"robe" of a diksha-guru and occupy the position of God. Well, now here
in Russia also appear so called "guru-gods". For such a self-appointed
gurus, ISKCON ― is a big "*PIE*", and each of them wants his have
"*piece of pie*".

(C.c. Madhya, 9.61, purport)

COMMENTARY:

Word "Diksha" consists of two syllables "DI" and "KSA" which contain
significant importance and meaning. Syllable "DI" means - *Divya-jnana*
knowledge of God and our relations with Him (svarupa) and *all this
together*\ is conveyed within the **mantra** which we receive from Guru.
Syllable "KSA" means – to annihilate. (In this case it concerns the
sin). So, that person who is able to **place** this *mantra* in the
heart of a seeker can be called a "*Diksha-guru*" and the process
through which spiritual master liberates disciple from sins is
identified as *diksha* or initiation. **Bona fide**\ guru – is ONE! Only
person who has received a special authority from Supreme Personality of
Godhead or from previous *acharya* in the chain of true disciplic
succession can be such a *diksha-guru*. This "Diksha" diagram is very
clear even without our commentary. But presently there appear so many of
false gurus that we had to make this explanation for sincere and honest
souls attracted by this Movement for Krishna Consciousness and also for
neophytes wishing to accept a spiritual master.

**Conclusion**: Only such a person like |SP| is worth of
being a *DIKSA-GURU*.

Crime of GBC
============================================================================

His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada created and
developed the International Society for Krishna consciousness which He
based on seven main goals fixed in the ISKCON registration certificate
from July 13 1966.

This is the way installed by |SP| for International Society for Krishna consciousness. Seven main goals:

1. To systematically propagate spiritual knowledge to society at large
   and to educate all peoples in the techniques of spiritual life in
   order to check the imbalance of values in life and to achieve real
   unity and peace in the world.

2. To propagate a consciousness of Krishna, as it is revealed in the
   Bhagavad-gītā and the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam.

3. **To bring the members of the Society together with each other and
   nearer to Krishna**, the prime entity, thus to develop the idea
   within the members, and humanity at large, that each soul is part and
   parcel of the quality of Godhead (Krishna).

4. To teach and encourage the saṅkīrtana movement, congregational
   chanting of the holy names of God as revealed in the teachings of
   Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

5. To erect for the members, and for society at large, a holy place of
   transcendental pastimes, dedicated to the personality of Krishna.

6. **To unite members of the society into joint famaly** for the purpose
   of teaching a simpler and more natural way of life.

7. With a view towards achieving the aforementioned purposes, to publish
   and distribute periodicals, magazines, books and other writings.

|SP| wanted to see the International society for Krishna consciousness 
exactly like this, He wanted us to walk ONLY this way and
make all these seven goals come true. If we are attentive to the
development of our Krishna consciousness Movement we can easily
recognize that far from all of these purposes are fulfilled for hundred
percent. Third point is executed partly, but *sixth point is totally
ignored.*

Thanks to a superhuman efforts and unusual activity in the perfect
transcendental preaching of |HDGSP| the
International society for Krishna consciousness quickly succeeded and
became popular among youth of America. When this Movement started taking
huge range |SP| created GBC for governing the 
International society for Krishna consciousnesses (ISKCON). He drew a plane of
management and fixed all the necessary standards and instructions for
the further management of ISKCON.

|SP| introduces GBC as the highest managing authority and
this is specifically noted in His Declaration of will.

1. **The Governing Body Commission (GBC) will be the ultimate managing
   authority of the entire Internationa Society for Krishna Consciousness.**

(|SP|, Declaration of Will 4.06.77 point 2)

This can make an impression that GBC has full power to manage ISKCON.
However, in the second clause of this Declaration |SP|
clearly defines its role as executive and accurately fixes the limits of
its scope of authority.

2. **Each temple will be an ISKCON property and will be managed by three
   executive directors. The system of management will continue as it is
   now and there is no need of any change.**

(|SP|, Declaration of Will 4.06.77 point 3)

GBC also gives definition of its own duties:

"Resolved: The GBC (Governing Body Commission) has been established by
His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada to represent Him in
carrying out the *responsibility of managing* the International Society
for Krishna Consciousness of which He is the Founder-Acarya and supreme
authority. The GBC **accepts as its life and soul His divine
instructions** and recognizes that it is completely dependent on His
mercy in all respects. The GBC **has no other function or purpose other
than to execute the instructions** so kindly given by His Divine Grace
and **preserve** and spread His Teachings to the world **in their pure
form."**

(Definition of GBC, Resolution 1, GBC minutes 1975)

“In order to receive first initiation, one must have been a full time
member for six months. For second initiation there should be at least
another one year after the first initiation.”

(GBC Resolution No. 9, March 25th, 1975)

These resolutions were specially issued to exactly define how ISKCON
should be managed and were approved by |SP|. They clearly
define the responsibility and limits of GBC’s authority, which is
entrusted duties of managing the society. As you have already guessed,
dear devotees, these standards are not followed by GBC and we know
nothing about them. Further we shall understand how GBC, guided by its
own invented ideas suggested by *divyi-maya,* destroys the Movement of
Krishna Consciousness created by |SP| with such a care.

Immediately after |SP|’s departure GBC refused to follow
directions of our acharya and their promises, notarized in written form.
And they have been preparing it with much care. When |SP|
was still alive (physically present) after 1972, they started making
changes in His books trying to adapt them to their invented philosophy,
particularly where *diksha-guru* matter was concerned. By that they were
preparing a base ground for their criminal activity in the future. They
started with "Bhagavad-gītā as it is". Harikesha Svami was imposed a
responsibility to execution of this criminal affair. There were many
crimes caused by GBC including murders, violence, threats, beating and
forbids.

And now we see that all books of |SP| are changed as
compared to their essential condition. The Publishers B.B.T.
(Bhaktivedanta Book Trust) acknowledge the fact that at the request of
GBC they made changes in the books of |SP| to remove phrases
"inconvenient" for GBC.

In all books there are made more than thousand changes of philosophical
nature. In the second publishing of Bhagavad-gītā there were made more
than hundred changes and additions by GBC instructions and without any
authoritative sanctions. In third publishing of "Bhagavad-gītā" in 2001
there were made so many changes and additions that it cannot be called
"Bhagavad-gītā **as it is**" any longer. A lot of changes also appeared
in |SP|’s commentaries and in the translation of Sanskrit
text.

We shall give analysis of only one very important verse of Bhagavad-gītā
4.34 and its commentary, revealing the truth for the general good. In
this verse words of Krishna were changed. In first two sentences Krishna
speaks of spiritual master in singular. In the third sentence it is
changed for plural.

Here we present the changed verse. (B.g. 4.34.) published after 1972.

   *tad viddhi pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya*

   *upadeksyanti te jnanam jnaninas tattva darsinah*

SYNONYMS

*Tat — that knowledge of different sacrifices; viddhi — try to
understand; pranipätena — by approaching a spiritual master;
pariprasnena — by submissive inquiries; sevayä — by the rendering of
service; upadeksyanti—*\ **they will initiate**\ *; te—you; jnänam—into
knowledge; jnäninah — the self-realized; tattva — of the truth; darsinah
— seers.*

TRANSLATION

“Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire
from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized
**souls** can impart knowledge unto you because **they have**\ seen the
truth”.

Here we present the authentic verse. (B.g. 4.34.1972).

   *tad viddhi pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya*

upadeksyanti te jnanam jnaninas tattva darsinah

SYNONYMS

*Tat — that knowledge of different sacrifices; viddhi — try to
understand; pranipätena — by approaching a spiritual master;
pariprasnena — by submissive inquiries; sevayä — by the rendering of
service; upadeksyanti—*\ **initiate;**\ *te — unto you; jnänam —
knowledge; jnäninah — the self-realized; tattva — of the truth; darsinah
— seers.*

TRANSLATION

“Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire
from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized
**soul** can impart knowledge unto you because **he has**\ seen the
truth”.

In letter for letter translation of this verse the Sanskrit word
*upadeksyanti* - to **initiate** and this is literally translated as -
"show initiative" or, in other words, "be capable" they have translated
it in plural adding words - "**they will**", to word "**initiate**",
that means – **they are capable**. Аnd in literary translation, word
"he", that is to say the soul, (singular) was changed for word "they"
(plural). This is how they cheat simple-hearted people, changing holy
scriptures, adapting them to their invented philosophy of *guru-tattva*.

As we see Sanskrit texts themselves remain unchanged, but word-for-word
and literary translations are changed. There are already three versions
of this verse and commentary to it.

Here we present second version of the changed verse. (B.g. 4.34. 2001)
Russian publishing.

"*To learn the truth, entrust yourself to a spiritual master.* Inquire
from him submissively and render service unto him. *The self-realized
souls can impart knowledge unto you because they have seen the truth".*

The third version of the changed verse (B.g. 4.34.):

"Try to learn the truth addressing a spiritual master. Inquire from him
submissively and render service unto him. *The self-realized souls are
able to open the knowledge to you because they have already realized
it".*

We bring to your attention a small paragraph of the |SP|’s
changed commentary to the verse 4.34., where there was added whole
sentence, which |SP| never wrote:

**"Nor by independent study of books of knowledge can one progress in
spiritual life."**

(B.g.1986. the verse 4.34. commentary)

Changed commentary (B.g. 4.34. after 1972).

"Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot **help lead one
to the right path. Nor by independent study of books of knowledge can
approach a bona fide spiritual life.** One has to approach a bona fide
spiritual master to receive the knowledge "

The authentic commentary (B.g. 4.34., before 1972).

"Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help **one
progress in spiritual life.** One has to approach a bona fide spiritual
master to receive the knowledge"

And here is what |SP| says himself:

"In my books the philosophy of Krishna Consciousness is explained
**fully**\ so if there is anything which you do not understand, then you
simply have to read again and again. By reading daily **the knowledge
will be revealed to you** and by this process your **spiritual life will
develop**." (Letter to Bahurupa 22.11. 74).

What for would |SP| write so many books if studying them
nobody would be able to develop spiritually? What for? |SP|
says: "**Spread my Books in thousands, a millions. Study my books and
then you will get the answers to all of your questions".**

Here is a small fragment from book "Last days of Prabhupada" Tamal Krishna Gosvami.

EPILOGUE

"|SP| says (record from June 9): "If you want to know me,
read my books". Presently in some circles it is usual to consider that
to understand the books of *Maha-bhagavata* and *Maha-bhagavata* himself
is only possible by listening the explanations of the other
*maha-bhagavata*. But |SP| himself considers that it is
enough to read His books for that. *If this were impossible, then would
it be worth for Him to take so much strain to write them*?" (Bhakti
Vijnana Gosvami, November 8 2002)

Here we completely agree with B.V. Goswami Maharaja. There is no need to
search for the other *Maha-bhagavata* to understand |SP|’s
books and Praphupada himselfHis. To progress spiritually we need to
surrender to |SP| and attentively read His books. Thus, by
means of his books |SP| endows us with transcendental
knowledge (*divya-jnana*). From here it follows that transaction of
transcendental knowledge is the initiation.

**Dīkṣā actually means initiating a
disciple with transcendental knowledge by which he becomes freed from
all material contamination.**

--C.C., Madhya, 4. 111. commentary

Since |SP| by means of His books initiates us with
transcendental knowledge He becomes for us a **bona
fide**\ *diksha-guru*. Despite his positive words about the philosophy
presented in |SP|’s books Bhakti Vijnana Goswami Maharaja
still assumed a responsibility of a *diskha-guru* and accepts disciples
initiating them on his own name.

Recently GBC has made one more innovation in order to strengthen somehow
already weakened *sidhanta*. They have added to their *pranama*, |SP|’s
*pranama*, hoping thereby to correct the situation and
raise spiritual power among devotees. Such an innovation cannot correct
the hopeless situation in our Society. Until GBC abandons its invented
concept of initiation and accepts the last order of |SP|
from (July 9 1977) the state of things wouldn’t better. This means that
they should occupy position of *shiksha-guru* and act as ritviks
(priests), they should conduct ritual of initiation on behalf of |SP|,
chant on the beads, give spiritual name to the disciple,
inform him that now he is a disciple of |SP| and that he
should read *pranama-mantra* to |SP| only.

If devotee wants to progress spiritually he must chant *pranama* to
|SP| only, meditate on Him and serve Him. Devotee should not
chant *pranama* to these "gurus" and accept them as object of meditation
and service, as well as consider them to be infallible.

This is how they shelter themselves behind the name of |SP|
in order to remain on the position of *diksha-guru*.

As we already know *diksha-guru* should be on the level of
*Maha-bhagavata*.

  *mahā-bhāgavata-śreṣṭho brāhmaṇo vai gurur nṛṇām*

  *sarveṣām  eva  lokānām asau pūjyo yathā hariḥ*

  *mahā-kula-prasūto pi sarva-yajñeṣu dīkṣitaḥ*

  *sahasra-śākhādhyāyī ca na guruḥ syād avaiṣṇavaḥ*

  **"The guru must be situated on
  the topmost platform of devotional service. There are three classes of
  devotees, and the guru must be
  accepted from the topmost class. The first-class devotee is the
  spiritual master for all kinds of people".**

 **When one has attained the topmost position
 of mahā-bhāgavata, he is to be accepted as
 a guru  and worshiped exactly
 like Hari, the Personality of
 Godhead. Only such a person is eligible to occupy the post of
 a guru.**

 --C.C., Madhya, 24.330, commentary

Unauthorized ISKCON gurus can initiate no one into Krishna consciousness
since they do not possess the necessary qualification and never got
instructions to initiate others. Indeed, they simply defraud the
unsophisticated people using all kind of tricks. All whom they accept as
their disciples and supposedly give initiation into chanting Hare
Krishna *Maha-mantra* are already initiated with Hare Krishna mantra by
|HDGSP| by means of His books. In other words
if person has got the *Maha-mantra* from books of |SP| and
started sincerely repeating it daily on 16 rounds following directions
of |SP|, then initiation has already taken place in his
heart. Desire of power, fame, money, worship of oneself and control over
other devotees pushes them to commit a crime (make changes in holy
scriptures) and give their false interpretation of *guru-tattva*
philosophy.

*|SP| says*: “As soon as you interpret or change the
scriptures, the scripture loses its authority. Then another man will
come and interpret things in his own way. Another will come and then
another, and in this way the original purport of the scripture is lost.”

“Those who first broke away from the message as it is and those who
followed them by breaking away themselves are both to blame.”

(Dialectical Spirotualism)

Dear devotees please pay your attention to what |SP| says.
Many of us, maybe even each, try to spread Krishna consciousness
everywhere and we should be very careful in what we preach. We must
understand and fully realize what are we preaching and never deviate
from the teaching of |SP| even for a jot. If we preach
distorted philosophy of *guru-tattwa*, presented by unauthorized ISKCON
gurus, which disagrees with siddhanta clearly installed by |SP|.
In other words, if we in our preaching present unauthorized
ISKCON gurus as *bona fide* *diksha-gurus*, representatives of Supreme
Personality of Godhead, then it will lead us to spiritual degradation
and suffering in the end, because of our own invalid interpretation of
Vedic literature.

*|SP| says*: “Holy scripture is energy of God. The Supreme
Peraonality of Godhead spreads his energy, and this energy is His
principle.”

“If we apply our finite reasoning and try to change God’s instructions
according to our whims, we will suffer."

(Dialectical Spiritualism)

The blame for such a CRIME, changing the holy scriptures, fully lays on
GBC.

"**Each temple will be an ISKCON property**\ and will be managed by
three executive directors. The system of *management\ *\ **will continue
as it is now and there is no need of any change**".

(|SP|, Declaration of Will 4.06. 1977 point 2)

“The executive directors who have herein been designated are appointed
for life. In the event of death or failure to act for any reason of any
of the said directors, a successor director or directors may be
appointed by the remaining directors, provided the new director is **my
initiated disciple** following strictly all the rules and regulations of
the International Society for Krishna Consciousness as detailed in my
books, and provided that there are never less than three (3) or more
than five (5) exeutive directors acting at one time.”

(|SP|, Declaration of Will 4.06.1977 the point 3)

“\ **This is the function of the GBC**, to see that one may not be taken
away by maya. The GBC should all be the **instructor**\ *\ *\ **gurus**.
**I am the initiator guru**, **and you should be the**\ **instructor
guru** by teaching what I am teaching and doing what I am doing. This is
not a title, but you must actually come to this platform. **This is what
I want."**

(Letter of |SP| to Madhudvisa, 4.08.75)

**“Now I have invested the GBC for maintaining the standard of our Krsna
Consciousness Society, so keep the GBC very vigilant. I have already
given you full directions in my books.”**

(|SP|, letter to Satsvarupa 13.9.70)

**“The standards I have already given you, now try to maintain them at
all times under standard procedure. Do not try to innovate or create
anything or manufacture anything, that will ruin everything.”**

(|SP| Letter to Bali Mardan and Pusta Krsna, 18/9/72)

**“I have appointed originally 12 GBC members and I have given them 12
zones for their administration and management, but simply by agreement
you have hanged everything, so what is this, I don’t know.”**

(|SP| Letter to Rupanuga, 4/4/72)

**“What will happen when I am not here, shall everything be spoiled by
GBC?”**

(|SP| Letter to Hansadutta, 11/4/72)

Being a *tri-kala-gia* |SP| has foreseen what would happen
after His death and all these anxiety |SP| was showing
especially for us, so that we would be able to give correct judgment to
the circumstances we may face in the future.

We would like to turn your attention to the point 3 of the Declaration
of Will from 04. 06. 1977. It can be fulfilled only in case the second
clause of given Declaration of Will and **directive** from 09. 07. 1977
(see appendix) is observed. It becomes clear from here that new coming
devotees should become disciples of His Divine Grace А. C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada.
This process should be followed for as long as ISKCON exists.

Directive from 9.07.1977 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ISKCON**

INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS

Founder-Acharya: His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada

July 9th, 1977.

To All G.B.C. and Temple Presidents,

Dear Maharajas and Prabhus,

Please accept my humble obeisances at your feet. Recently when all of
the GBC members were with His Divine Grace in Vrndavana, |SP|
indicated that soon He would appoint some of His senior
disciples to act as "rittik"- representative of the acarya, for the
purpose of perfoming initiations, both first initiation and second
initiation. His Divine Grace has so far given a list of eleven disciples
who will act in that capacity:

His Holiness Kirtanananda Swami

His Holiness Satsvarupa das Goswami

His Holiness Jayapataka Swami

His Holiness Tamal Krsna Goswami

His Holiness Hrdayananda Goswami

His Holiness Bhavananda Goswami

His Holiness Hamsadutta Swami

His Holiness Ramesvara Swami

His Holiness Harikesa Swami

His Grace Bhagavan das Adhikari

His Grace Jayatirtha das Adhikari

In the past, Temple Presidents have written to |SP|,
recommending a particular devotee's initiation. Now that |SP|
has named these representatives, Temple Presidents may
*henceforward*\ send recommendation for first and second initiation to
whichever of these representatives are nearest their temple. After
considering the recommendation, these representatives may accept the
**devotee as an initiated disciple of |SP|** by giving a
spiritual name, or in the case of second initiation, by chanting on the
Gayatri thread, just as |SP| has done. **The newly initiated
devotees are disciples of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada**,
the above eleven senior devotees acting as His
representative. After the Temple President receives a letter from these
representatives, giving a spiritual name or the thread, he can perform
the fire yajna in the temple as was being done before. **The name of a
newly initiated disciple should be sent by the representative who has
accepted him or her to |SP|, to be included in His Divine
Grace's "Initiated Disciples" book.**

Hoping this finds you all well

Your servant,

*(signature appears on the original document)*

Approved Tamal Krsna Goswami

Secretary to |SP| *(|SP|'s signature appears on
the original document)*

**Even GBC itself confessed this document to be original.**

In this document it is three times said that these new initiated
devotees are disciples of |HDGSP|.

**“So as soon as one thing is three times stressed, that means final.”**

(|SP| Bg. Lecture, 27/11/68, Los Angeles)

In this directive |HDGSP| expressed in
absolutely clear way his intention to remain a diksha-guru for the whole
ISKCON and accept disciples through His representatives as long as the
International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) exists.

**"...continue to become**\ **ritviks**\ **and act on my behalf**.".
(Letter from 31.07. 77)

Commenting on the July 9\ :sup:`th` order, *Jayadvaita Swami* recently
wrote:

**“Its authority is beyond question [...] Clearly, this letter
establishes a**\ **ritvik-guru**\ **.”**

(Jayadvaita Swami ‘Where the Ritvik People are Wrong’ 1996)

**ROOM CONVERSATION July 7th, 1977, Vrindavan**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:**\ |SP|, we are receiving a number
of letters now, and these are people

who want to get initiated. So, up until now, since you’re becoming ill,
we asked

them to wait.

**|SP|:**\ The local men, senior sannyasis can do that.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:**\ That’s what we were doing... l mean,
formally we were...the local GBC, sannyasis

were chanting on their beads, and they were writing to Your Divine
Grace; and

you were giving a spiritual name. So should that process be resumed, or
should

we...? l mean, one thing is that it is said that the spiritual master
takes on the...you

know, he takes on the...he has to cleanse the disciple by...so we don’t
want that

you should have to uh...your health is not so good, so that should not
be...that’s

why we’ve been asking everybody to wait. I just want to know if we
should

continue to wait come more time.

**|SP|:**\ No, the senior sannyasis...

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** So they should continue to...

**|SP|:**\ You can give me a list of sannyasis. I’ll mark
who will...

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:**\ Ok.

**|SP|:** You can do. Kirtanananda can do. And our
Satsvarupa can do. So these three, you

** **\ can give, begin.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** So supposing someone is in America, should
they simply write directly to

Kirtanananda or Satsvarupa?

**|SP|:** Nearby. Jayatirtha can give.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** Jayatirtha.

**|SP|:** Bhagavan. And he can do also. Harikesa.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** Harikesa Maharaja.

**|SP|:**\ And...five, six men, you divide, who is nearest.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** Who is nearest. So persons wouldn’t have to
write to Your Divine Grace. They

could write directly to that person?

**|SP|:** Hm.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** Actually they are initiating that person on
Your Divine Grace’s behalf. The persons

who are initiated are still your...

**|SP|:** Second initiation. We shall think over, second
initiation.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** This is for the first initiation. OK. And for
second initiation, for the time being they

should...

**|SP|:** No, they have to wait. Second initiation, that
should be given...

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** Should...some devotees are writing you now
for second initiation, and l am writing

them to wait a while, because you are not will. So can l continue to
tell them that?

**|SP|:** They can be second initiation.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** By writing you?

**|SP|:** No. These men.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** These men. They can also do second
initiation. So there’s no need for devotees to

write to you for first and second initiation. They can write to the man
nearest them.

But all these persons are still your disciples. Anybody who gives
initiation is doing

so on your behalf.

**|SP|:** Yes.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** You know that book I’m maintaining of all of
your disciple’s names? Should l

continue that?

**|SP|:** Hm.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** So if someone gives initiation. like Harikesa
Maharaja, he should send the person’s

name to us here, and I’ll enter it into the book. OK. Is there someone
else in India

that your want to do this?

**|SP|:** India? I am here. We shall see. In India
Jayapataka.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** Jayapataka Maharaja?

**|SP|:** You are also in India. You can note down these
names.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** Yes I have them.

**|SP|:** Who are they?

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** Kirtanananda Maharaja, Satsvarupa Maharaja,
Jayatirtha Prabhu, Bhagavan Prabhu,

Harikesa Maharaja, Jayapataka Maharaja, and Tamal KrisnaMaharaja.

**|SP|:** That’s nice. Now you distribute.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** Seven. There’s seven names.

**|SP|:** For the time being, seven names, sufficient. ...
You can make, Ramesvara.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** Ramesvara Maharaja.

**|SP|:** And Hrdayananda.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** Oh, yeah. South America.

**|SP|:** So without waiting for me, whoever you consider
deserves...That will depend on

discretion.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:**\ On discretion.

**|SP|:** Yes.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** That’s first and second initiations.

**|SP|:** Hm.

** Tamal Krisna Gosvami:** Shall I send a kirtana party, |SP|?

ISKCON

INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS

Founder-Acharya: His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada

July 11th, 1977

My dear Kirtanananda Maharaja,

Please accept my most humble obeisances at your feet. His Divine Grace
Sri la Prabhupad has just received the latest issue of Brijabasi Spirit,
Vol. IV, No.4, which brought Him great joy. As He looked at the cover
showing Kaladri performing a fire ceremony, He said: "Just see his face
how devotee he is, so expert in everything." When |SP| opened
the first page, His eyes fixed on the picture of Radha-Vrindavana
Candra, and He said: "Vrindavana Bihari - so beautiful. There is no
danger wherever Vrindavana Candra is." After enjoying the whole magazine
thoroughly, |SP| said: "It is printed on their own press. It
is very good progress." His Divine Grace very much appreciated the
article 'How I Was Deprogrammed' by the young devotee boy. Prabhupad was
feeling great sympathy when he heard his story and said: "If one man is
turned like this boy, then this movement is successful. There is good
prospect, good hope. You all combine together and push this movement on
and on. Now I am assured that it will go on." While going through the
magazine, |SP| also saw your good photo on the page
'Istagosthi', and |SP| bestowed a long loving look upon your
good self, expressing his deep appreciation for how you have understood
this Krsna Consciousness.

A letter has been sent to all the Temple Presidents and GBC which you
should be receiving soon, describing the process for initiation to be
followed in the future. |SP| has appointed thus far eleven
representatives who will initiate new devotees on His behalf. You can
wait for this letter to arrive (the original has been sent to Ramesvara
Maharaja for duplicating), and then all of the persons whom you
recommended in your previous letters can be initiated.

His Divine Grace has been maintaining His health on an even course, and
most amazingly has doubled His translation work, keeping pace with the
doubling of book distribution. Hoping this meets you well.

Your servant,

Fragment from Yashodanandan Svami diary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*Here I want to present a fragment from Yashodanandana Svami’s diary.
This episode describes the dialogue which took place between
Yashodanandan Svami and Tamala-Krishna Goswami on July 10 1977.*

10 July, 9-25 morning. Tamala-Krishna Maharaja comes from |SP|’s room near the garden (I came from gurucul).

**Tamala-Krishna Gosvami**: Hari Bol. Yashoda have you seen it?

**Yashodanandana Svami**: No, what is this?

**Tamala-Krishna Gosvami**: This is signed by Prabhupada. (He was shown
the signature of |SP| in the left lower corner of the
letter. I read the letter and asked him):

**Yashodanandana Svami**: What does it all mean?

**Tamala-Krishna Gosvami**: Devotees were writing to Prabhupada asking
for initiation but now Prabhupada has named eleven ritviks who can give
initiations on his name. Prabhupada said that later others can be added.

**Yashodanandana Svami:** But when Prabhupada leaves?

**Tamala-Krishna Gosvami:** They will be ritviks. This is what
Prabhupada said. All this is recorded on the tape-recorder. Hari bol. I
returned to gurucula pondering about the talk with Maharaja.

LETTER from Tamal Krsna Goswami to Hansadutta.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(on |SP|’s behald)

July 31st, 1977

My dear Hamsadutta Maharadja,

Please accerpt my most humble obeisances at your feet. I have been
instructed by |HDGSP| to thank you for your
letter dated July 25th, 1977.

You have written to |SP| saying you do not know why He has
chosen you to be a recipient of his mercy. His Divine Grace immediately
replied: “It is because you are my sincere servant. You have given up
attachment for a beautiful and qualified wife and that is a great
benediction. You are a real preacher. Therefore I like you. (*then
laughing*) Sometimes you become obstinate, but that is true of any
intelligent man. Make your own field and continue to be **ritvik** and
act on my behalf.”

|SP| listened with great enthusiasm as I read to him the
newspaper article. His Divine Grace was very pleased: “This article will
increase your prestige. It is very nice article. Therefore the newspaper
has spared so much space to print it. It is very nice. It must be
published in *Back to Godhead*. Now, there is a column in the *Bask to
Godhead* called ‘Prabhupad Speaks Out’. Your article may be entitled
‘Prahupad’s Disciple Speaks Out’. Yes, we shall publish this article
certainly. Let this rascal be fool before the public. I have enjoyed
this article very much. I want my disciples to speak out...backed by
complete reasoning. *Brahma sutra sunisthita*, this is preaching. Be
blessed. All my disciples go forward, You have given the challenge They
cannot answer. This Dr. Kovoor should be invited...For Dr. Svarupa
Damodara’s convention on ‘Life comes from Life’. He can learn something
at this scientific conference.”

Yes, you should certainly get come ISKON Food Relief money. For your
program, American money collected and sent for food distribution. That
is my proposal. Three hundred people coming is no joke. You mentioned so
many nice preparations. I would like to eat but l cannot. At simply
hearing these names (of preparations) it is satisfying. Just thinking
this morning of you, and now you have written me.

(last paragraph illegible)

   Your Servant,

**PYRAMID HOUSE CONFESSIONS December 3rd, 1980, Los Angeles**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tamal Krsna Maharaja:** 'I've had a certain realization a few days
ago.(...) There are obviously so many statements by |SP|
that his Guru Maharaja did not appoint any successors.(...) Even in
|SP|'s books he says guru means by qualification...)

The inspiration came because there was a questioning on my part, so
Krishna spoke. Actually Prabhupada never appointed any gurus. He
appointed eleven *ritviks*. He never appointed them gurus. Myself and
the other GBC have done the greatest disservice to this movement the
last three years because we interpreted the appointment of *ritviks* as
the appointment of gurus.

What actually happened I'll explairi. I explained it but the
interpretation is wrong. What actually happened was that Prabhupada
mentioned he might be appointing some *ritviks*, so the GBC met for
various reasons, and they went to Prabhupada, five or six of us. (This
refers to the meeting of May 28th, 1977). We asked him, '|SP|,
after your departure, if we accept disciples, whose
disciples will they be, your disciples or mine?'

Later on there was a piled up list of people to get initiated, and it
was jammed up. I said, '|SP|, you once mentioned about
*ritviks*. I don't know\what to do. We don't want to approach you, but
there's hundreds of devotees named, and I'm just holding all the
letters. I don't know what you want to do'.

**|SP| said**\ **,** 'All right, I will appoint so many...'
and he started to name them. He made it very clear that they are his
disciples. At that point it was very clear in my mind that they were his
disciples. Later on I asked him two questions, one: 'What about
Brahmananda Swami?'. I asked him this because I happened to have an
affection for Brahmananda Swami.(...) **So |SP| said**, 'No,
not unless he is qualified'. Before I got ready to type the letter, I
asked him, two: '|SP| is this all or do you want to add
more?'

*He said*, **'As is necessary, others may be added**.'

Now I understand that what he did was very clear. He was phsically
incapable of performing the function of initiation; therefore he
appointed *officiating\ *\ **priests**\ *to initiate on his behalf*. He
appointed eleven, and he said very clearly, 'Whoever is nearest can
initiate'. This is very important because when it comes to initiating,
it isn't whoever is nearest, it's whereveryour heart goes. Who (you)
repose your faith on, you take initiation from him. But when it's
officiating, it's whoever is nearest, and he was very clear. He named
them. They were spread out all over the world, and he said, 'Whoever
your'e nearest, you just approach that person, and they'll check you
out. Then, on my behalf, they'll initiate.' It is not a question that
you repose your faith in that person - nothing. That's a function for
the guru. 'In order for me to manage this movement, Prabhupada said, 'I
have to form a GBC and I will appoint the following people. In order to
continue the process of people joining our movement and getting
initiated, I have to appoint some **priests**\ *to help me* because
(...) I cannot physically manage everyone myself.'

And that's all it was, and it was never any more than that, you can bet
your bottom dollar that Prabhupada would have spoken for days and hours
and weeks on end about how to set up this thing with the gurus, because
he had already said it a million times. He said: 'My Guru Maharaja did
not appoint anyone. It's by qualification.' We made a great mistake.
After Prabhupada's departure what is the position of these eleven
people? (...)

Prabhupada showed that it is not just *sannyasis*. He named two people
who were *grihastas*, who could at least be *ritviks*, showing that they
were equal to any sannyasi. So anyone who is spiritually qualified -
it's always been understood that you cannot accept disciples in the
presence of your guru, but when the guru disappears, you can accept
disciples if you are qualified and someone can repose their faith. Of
course, they (prospective disciples) should be fully appraised at how to
distinguish who is a proper guru. But if you are a proper guru, and your
guru is no longer present, that is your right. It's like a man can
procreate (...) Unfortunately the GBC did not recognise this point. They
immediately (assumed, decided) that these eleven people are the selected
gurus. I can definitely say for myself, and for which I humbly beg
forgiveness from everybody, that there was definitely some degree of
trying to control (...) This is the conditioned nature, and it came out
in the highest position of all, 'Guru, oh wonderful! Now I am guru, and
there is only eleven of us'(...).

I feel that this realization or this understanding is essential if we
are to avoid further things from happening, because, believe me, it's
going to repeat. It's just a question of time until things have a little
bit faded out and again another incident is going to happen, whether
it's here in L.A. or somewhere else. It's going to continuously happen
until you allow the actual spiritual force of Krishna to be exhibited
without restriction^...) I feel that the GBC body, if they don't adopt
this point very quickly, if they don't realize this truth. You cannot
show me anything on tape or in writing where Prabhupada says: 'I appoint
these eleven as gurus.'. It does not exist because he never appointed
any gurus. This is a myth. (...) The day you got initiated you get the
right to be come a father when your father disappears, *if you are
qualified*. No appointment. It doesn't require an appointment, because
there isn't one.

The apostates
============================================================================


Here is what has later become of these eleven apostates.

**1**. ― **Kirtanananda**

On his order three devotees were killed. He was caught in train on
homosexual contact with boy. Some matajies were involved into
prostitution on his order, devotees were selling drugs, one devotee was
drowned. He was sentenced to twenty years of prison. Later after jail
release he got imprisoned second time for racket. He was released in
2004 and tried to continue his criminal activity as a guru.

**2.** ― **Jayatirtha**

Was taking drugs, involved into sex with disciples. He was saying that
he was a Krishna and they were his gopies. Was killed by one of his
disciples for raping his wife.

**3.** ― **Bhagavan**

Has run away with someone else’s wife and money. Later he got into
prison. - Left ISKCON.

**4**. ― **Bhavananda**

Was involved into homosexual contacts in Mayapur and Vrindavan - left
ISKCON.

**5**. ― **Rameshvara**

Ran away with money and fourteen years old girl.

**6.** ― **Hamsaduta**

Was taking drugs, had sexual contacts with disciples - left ISKCON.

**7.** ― **Harikesha**

Has robed off ISKCON for 2 ml.$ and ran away with his massager, got
married. Sold huge mansion, which was earlier gifted to him by his
disciples, on North Riviera for 1.2 ml. $.

**8.** **―**\ **Hridayananda**

Teacher of the Sanskrit, teaches in the university, he earns his life
himself. He told to his disciples to take care of themselves on their
own. He is still concerned to be a functioning “guru”.

**9.** ― **Satsvarupa**

Is mildly crazy, he draws baby pictures. Was caught up on relationship
with a woman. Is still concerned to be a functioning “guru”.

**10.** ― **Tamala-Krishna**\ *\ *\ **Goswami**

Was |SP|’s secretary. Recently wanted to make some important
statement. He died in terrible car accident. There is a suspicion that
this was a pre planed murder.

**11. ―**\ **Jayapataka Svami**

If we look at him with the eyes of Lord Caytania then he was a fallen
sanyasi long ago. For a long period of time he was, put it mildly,
showing too much of interest towards females. We would like to wish him
to start paying interest to the last order from July 9 1977 and follow
it. He still acts as a “\ *diksha-guru*\ ”.

As soon as these "Apostates" rejected the order of the **bona fide**
spiritual master they quickly degraded down to *CRIMINALS*. As we can
see majority of them have really committed a felony. But GBC continued
to impose the worship of these criminals. None of them corresponds to
qualifications of the *bona fide* *guru*. They are all conditioned
souls. Desire to enjoy gross material pleasures pushes person to sinful
actions. Without firm faith in spiritual master and Krishna person
becomes a victim of *Maya*.

After |SP|s departure, these\ **ritviks** stopped the
process of initiation on His name and in 1978 they declared themselves
to be the only successors, thus displacing |SP| from his
legal place and entrenched His fortune, money and big number of His
disciples.

In the Mayapur temple there were placed eleven big vyasasanas (the
thrones) where they daily sited voluptuously for undertaking *guru-puja*
(the worships). They didn’t always obey GBC anymore and treated many of
their spiritual brothers as their own disciples. These self-appointed
gurus arranged for themselves such a splendid honors, which were never
even shown to |SP|. Thus they enjoyed |SP|’s
domain and thought that it is forever. However these self-appointed
gurus started falling (degrading) in a certain time. A wave of
resentment and indignations developed among devotees. To suppress this
growing revolt unauthorized gurus and their disciples used all kind of
means, including forbid, violence, and even murder. Few years later this
system of "zonal *acharyas*" proved its total failure, but GBC has done
nothing for recovering the authentic system of initiation ― the
**ritvik-system**. On the contrary they added about dozen new gurus.
They declared that actually any of the disciples can be a candidate for
*diksha-guru*. Those who are interested should submit their application
for GBC’s consideration.

This is how GBC, by voting chooses *diksha-gurus*. Such a system of
electing ISKCON “gurus” corresponds to the Christian procedure. This is
just like in the catholic churches the Holy Father is elected. Number of
unauthorized gurus of ISKCON increased up to eighty by now and continues
to grow.

**"Mundane votes have no jurisdiction to elect a Vaiṣṇava ācārya.
A Vaiṣṇava ācārya is self-effulgent, and there is no need for any court judgment."**

(C.C., Madhiya, 1.220, commentary)

**"Sri Jiva Gosvami
advises that one not accept a spiritual master in terms of hereditary or
customary social and ecclesiastical conventions."**

(C.C., Adi, 1.35, commentary)

Contradictory position of the GBC with regards to the guru question was
briefly determined by Jayadvayta Swami:

"The word "*appointed*" is never used. But there are "*candidates for
initiating guru*," votes are taken, and those who make it through the
procedures become "ISKCON-approved" or "ISKCON-authorized" gurus.

To boost your confidence: On one hand the GBC encourages you to be
initiated by a bona fide, authorized ISKCON guru and worship him like
God. On the other, it has an elaborate system of laws to invoke from
time to time *when your ISKCON-authorized guru falls down*. One might
perhaps be forgiven for thinking that for all the laws and resolutions
the role of guru is still a perplexity even for the GBC. ".

We quote one more of the Jayadvayta Swami’s articles:

**FACT**: ISKCON gurus have opposed, oppressed and driven out many
sincere godbrothers and godsisters.

**FACT**: ISKCON gurus have usurped and misused money, and diverted
other ISKCON resources for their own personal prestige and sense
gratification.

**FACT:** ISKCON gurus have had illicit sexual intercourse with both
women and men, and possibly children as well.

**FACT:**\ etc…….

(WHERE THE RITVIK PEOPLE ARE RIGHT by H. H. Jayadvaita Swami, 1996)

**You cannot simply elect a person to the post of the most exalted
sainthood"**

('Notes from the Editor', Back to Godhead #13-01/02, 1978)

**From Bhakti Caru Swami’s speech:**

"Like in 1987, although we had a reform, after so many gurus fell down,
there was a fifty man committee was formed and there was reform it was
not actually, at least my perception is that it was not actually a
reform. It was kind of watering down the same misconception and
continuing. Like what we did was we appointed some more gurus and opened
up the world for anybody to initiate wherever he wanted. Yes, I agree,
to begin with, I think at the beginning I said our main problem was
introducing a defective initiation system. And that defective system may
have been watered down to some extent but its still prevailing. After
Harikesa fell down in 1998, in 1999 I proposed that it’s obvious that we
are going in the wrong direction. Now, when you go wrong , when you know
you’re going in the wrong direction, what do you do? You stop to find
the right way. So for the time-being, let’s stop giving initiation and
find out what is actually the problem and what is the solution to this
problem, whether we can find a solution and until then, let us stop."

(Meeting in Toronto, July 20 2003)

These obvious facts once again confirm that ISKCON “gurus” do not have
the necessary qualities to be **diksha-gurus** and held an illegal
position.

The newcomers are told that it’s their own responsibility to carefully
check ISKCON gurus on the grounds of |SP|’s books and
instructions. They should make sure that guru has necessary qualities to
initiate. However once such a future disciple comes to a conclusion that
none of the present "physically present" gurus meets the standard and
that he wants to surrender to |SP| as his *diksha-guru*, he
is ruthlessly thrown out from the Society. Is it really fair? This
doesn’t happen only overseas but also in Russia.

Philosophical “survey” by Niranjana Swami
============================================================================

In summer 1999 Bhakta-das was on *darshan* (meeting) with Nirandjana
Swami and honestly confessed that for him **bona fide** *diksha-guru* is
|SP|.

**And here is what Nirandjana Swami said**: "What’s wrong is the
misconception that one can establish relationship of initiation with the
departed *Vaiṣṇava.* With such a *Vaiṣṇava* we can only have *shiksha*
relations… I didn’t do anything to prevent the relationship with |SP|,
I never destruct the relationship with |SP|. And
it's my duty to help those who depend on me to understand the |SP|’s
instructions in their life; to free them from any
misconception they may have from |SP|’s instructions; to show
them how Srila Prabhupdas instructions are perfect and complete; to
remove any doubts and dualities they may experience in |SP|s
instructions; give them all possible blessings that I can possibly give
and establish the relations with |SP| through his
instructions".

**Note**: I would like to ask Maharaja: "What have you given to your
disciples? Have you given them the correct understanding of what is
*diksha*? From whom do we get the *divya-jnana*? What is an
*initiation*? What is disciplic succession? What **concludes** the
meaning of the "Shrimad-Bhagavatam" teaching?

**Unauthorized**\ *spiritual master can only give his disciples
incomplete knowledge.*

Dear readers we have already discussed the afore-mentioned questions but
now we will try to briefly tell you our point of view on the last
question. What **concludes** the meaning of the "Shrimad-Bhagavatam"
teaching?

You may disapprove all what we say but you cannot argue against what
Krishna or *His representative* |HDGSP| says.

Śrīmad Bhāgavatam – is a science of Krishna the Primordial Lord, the
cause of all causes. Teaching of "Śrīmad Bhāgavatam" is consecutively
opened in the first nine songs , elevating person to the highest level
of the God realization. |SP| recommends to study the
Bhagavad-gītā first.

Bhagavad-gītā – is a direct revelation of Lord Krishna and if we try to
understand it we shall be able to understand Krishna. Nobody can lead
astray the one who got knowledge through revelation. Studying Gita
person completely realizes the position of Lord Krishna: and when he is
beside lotus feet of Krishna, he understands the tales about Krishna as
they are given in Śrīmad Bhāgavatam.

In Bhagavad-gītā Krishna says that He descends into material world for
two reasons: to remove the violations in religions and to please his
devotees, those who are always thirsty to see Him. Also He comes to
attract the conditioned souls to Himself and invite everyone into His
transcendental abode, invite them to come back home to God.

In (Bhagavad gita. 4.9.) Krishna says:

 *janma karma ca me divyam evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ*

 *tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so ’rjuna*

**"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and
activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this
material world, but attains My eternal abode,
O Arjuna."**

Here comes a question: how to perceive the transcendental nature of the
Lord? Lord Krishna Himself gives the instructions, which help us to
understand. In (B.g. 4.34.) Krishna advises us to address the **bona
fide** spiritual master, who belongs to the chain of disciplic
succession.

Then Lord Krishna (B.g. 4.35.) emphasizes the importance of receiving
the transcendental knowledge from **bona fide** spiritual master and
assures us that we can safely take refuge beside lotus feet of such a
spiritual master. We should try to understand the instructions of the
Lord and follow them.

*|SP| says*: "Those who are not envious of Krishna accept
his instructions, surrender on to Him, and understand Him. For them,
this is the last material birth" (Dialectical spiritualism).

For those who are serious and sincerely wants to realize the
transcendental nature of the Lord and His deeds, |SP|
recommends to study Śrīmad Bhāgavatam consecutively starting from the
first song. In the very beginning of His multivolume work in the second
song of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, |SP| gives us very important
instructions:

**“In order to receive the real message
of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam one
should approach the current link, or spiritual master, in the chain of
disciplic succession."** (S.B., 2.9.7., commentary).

Further in Śrīmad Bhāgavatam |SP| tells us what kind of
personality is worth to be a representative of dicsiplic succession and
recommends to accept such a person as a *diksha-guru*. These
instructions are the base in realization of the "Shrimad-Bhagavatam"
teaching, and whole our spiritual life.

"One should take initiation from a **bona fide** spiritual master coming
in the disciplic succession, **who is authorized by his predecessor
spiritual master**. I his is called

(S.B. 4.8. 54. commentary)

It is self-evident that |SP| is an acharya of our sampradaya
next to the Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur. Consequently |SP|
is a present section in the chain. He represents the
disciplic succession at this time and thereby he is the person we shall
address to learn the meaning of the “Śrīmad Bhāgavatam" teaching.

So what *concludes* the meaning of the "Śrīmad Bhāgavatam" teaching?

Attentive and sincere study of Bagavad-gītā and the first nine songs of
Śrīmad Bhāgavatam makes one to understand following:

   <div style="text-align:center">
    Vedas advise us to address the <it>bona fide</it> spiritual master.
   </div>

*Surrendering oneself to the lotus feet of bona fide spiritual master
|SP|, the direct representative of Krishna, is a guaranteed
success in understanding the meaning of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam teaching.* The
whole snap of understanding the meaning of the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam
teaching is in this.

And thereby, as Lord says Himself, we return to His eternal abode.
Without surrendering oneself to bona fide representative of Krishna it
is impossible to understand the transcendental nature of the Lord and
His deeds. As a matter of fact to study only one Bhagavad-gītā is enough
for us to understand Krishna and reach His eternal abode. But
Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, which concludes the essence of the Vedas, presents
the most pure nectar of Lords transcendental lilas, the nectar for which
sincere bhaktas have such a powerful thirst. Śrīmad Bhāgavatam was told
for them by Viyasadeva - the embodiment of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. What |SP| says in His books is not different from
what Lord Krisha says Himself. Krishna explains to Arjune the importance
of receiving the transcendental knowledge from **bona fide** spiritual
master and |SP| also gives special importance to this in his
comments. For instance:

"Actually, anyone who HEARS
Bhagavad-gītā from a **bona fide**
spiritual master like `Kṛṣṇa <http://vedabase.net/k/krsna>`__ or *His
representative* will find that all his ignorance is dispelled. [ ] Any
person fortunate enough to HEAR these teachings from
`Kṛṣṇa <http://vedabase.net/k/krsna>`__ or *from His bona fide spiritual
representative is sure to become a liberated person* and get out of the
darkness of ignorance."

(B.g. 18. 72. commentary)

*|SP| says*: "As soon as one attentively and submissively
**HEAR** the message of
`Bhāgavatam <http://vedabase.net/b/bhagavatam>`__, by this culture of
knowledge the Supreme Lord is established within his heart.” (S.B.
1.1.2).

*Indeed*: "The essence of the Bhagavatam religion – is to confess that
God is the Supreme Lord".

*Janmādy*\ `asya <http://vedabase.net/a/asya>`__\ *yato 'nvayād itarataś
cārtheṣv*\ `abhijñaḥ <http://vedabase.net/a/abhijnah>`__\ `svarāṭ <http://vedabase.net/s/svarat>`__
(S.B. 1.1.1).

One can perceive this knowledge and become attached to the Supreme Lord
only by grace of *Bhagavata* - the *direct representative* of Bhagavana
Personality of Godhead (Sri Hari) and *in no other ways*.

*|SP| says*: **"These are not ordinary books. It is recorded
chanting. Anyone who reads, he**\ **is hearing**\ **.**"

(Letter of |SP| to Rupanuga 19.10. 74)

*Only our faith and full surrender* to |HDGSP|
will give us possibility to *HEARING* this recorded chanting.

"If one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his
direction, then one's perfection of life in
`Krishna <http://vedabase.net/k/krsna>`__ consciousness is guaranteed."

(B.g. 18. 57. commentary)

All holy scriptures talk about dedicated service to Krishna under
*guidance of His representative,* who at present moment is |SP|.

*|SP| says*: "But all such activities must be in
relationship with `Kṛṣṇa <http://vedabase.net/k/krsna>`__. This
relationship is established by connecting oneself with the **bona fide**
spiritual master, who is the *direct representative
of*\ `Kṛṣṇa <http://vedabase.net/k/krsna>`__\ *in disciplic
succession*.” ("Nectar of devotion" introduction).

We receive instructions and guidance in our devotional service from
|SP| *through His books*.

The essence of all Vedic literature is *concluded* in *Maha-mantra* holy
name of Krishna: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare
/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

We can get initiation into this mantra only from that person who is
granted with special authority from Supreme Personality of Godhead.

|SP| gives us **initiation** into chanting Hare Krishna
*Maha-mantra* by means of His books that are representing Him. This is a
very important matter and without understanding it we cannot progress
spiritually and be liberated from the shackles of material slavery.

In Padma Purana it is said:

"Unless you are initiated by a **bona fide** spiritual master *in the
disciplic succession*, the **mantra**\ that you might have received is
without any effect."

(The Science of the selfrealization ch. 2)

*According to the Bhagavad-gītā itself we should accept*\ **bona
fide**\ *guru who sees the TRUTH.*

Attentive study of the books Shrimat-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gītā will
leave no doubts that only |SP|, the *direct* representative
of Suprime Personality of Godhead, can be a **bona fide** *diksha-guru*
in our *Gauḍiya-sampradaya*. And the last instruction of |SP| (from July 9 1977)
contributes the final conclusion and
closes this urgent question, at least for ISKCON.

**Niranjana Svami continued**: "*and in this way, I take on the
responsibility to carry on the parampara*, to introduce them, to guide
them and nurture them in understanding the instructions. If I do
anything to pitch my disciples from |SP| then I would accept
that service which I’m running is completely useless. However according
to the law of the disciplic succession, which |SP| Himself
has stated, when the spiritual master departs His disciples accept their
own disciples. And those persons who are accepted as their disciples,
take them as their spiritual master."

**Note**: |SP| never said such nonsense and more so never
fixed anything like that. The only thing which |SP| fixed
was — "Declaration of Will from June 04 1977" and "last order from July
09 1977" where He expresses His last will in absolutely clear way. There
is confirmation for that in His books as well. *Such a statement of
Niranjana Svami is an egregious insulting invention.*

"One should take initiation from a *bona fide* spiritual master coming
in the disciplic succession, who is\ **authorized by his predecessor
spiritual master**\ **.**\ I his is called
`dīkṣā <http://vedabase.net/d/diksa>`__\ **-**\ `vidhāna <http://vedabase.net/v/vidhana>`__".

(Shrimad Bhagavatam, 4.8.54 commentary)

**"...disciplic succession does not always mean that one has to be
initiated officially. Disciplic succession means to**\ **accept**\ **the
disciplic conclusion.**

(S.P. Letter to Dinesh, 31/10/69)

This conclusion is - a concept of "No change" in ISKCON and GBC must
faultlessly follow it. |SP| never fixed anyone to be a
*Diksha-guru*.

"The GBC should all be the **instructor**\ *\ *\ **gurus**. **I am the
initiator guru**, **and you should be the**\ **instructor guru** by
teaching what I am teaching and doing what I am doing. This is not a
title, but you must actually come to this platform. **This is what I
want."**

(Letter of |SP| to Madhudvisa, 4.08.75)

**"Only Lord Chaytanya can occupy my place. He will take care of this
movement".**

(|SP| conversation 2.11.1977)

We can see how big should be the **false ego** of unauthorized gurus, to
state that:

"*I take on the responsibility to carry on the parampara* ".

**Niranjana Svami continued**: "|SP| would never do anything
contrary to the laws of the disciplic succession, without giving a
complete firm philosophical explanation. If He was going to do something
completely contradicting with the law of disciplic succession, why would
he do it using one word in the letter that he never even wrote, but
*only signed*, without giving any philosophical explanation. I state
that such a statements are offensive to my spiritual master".

**Note**: Niranjana Maharaja tries to justify his illegal position of
diksha-guru with his tangled meaningless gibberish and accuses devotee
in something incomprehensible. As it is said: offence is the best
defense.

**Bhakta-das**: "Excuse me, what kind of statements?"

**Niranjana Svami**: What kind of statements? The "henceforward" - from
this moment, (he pronounced it in russian).

**Bhakta-das: “**\ But it’s not my statement, |SP| says it.”

**Niranjana Svami**: “Not Prabhupada, Tamala Krishna wrote the letter".

**Bhakta-das**: "And Prabhupada has signed it without reading!"

**Nirandjana Svami**: "Prabhupada asked Tamala Krishna Maharaja to write
the letter. Tamala Krishna Maharaja wrote the whole letter. He has
written the whole letter from beginning to the end, *Prabhupada did not
write it*. No one wants to talk about Prabhupada’s departure either. And
if you were on the planet at the time you would know that. No one wanted
to say "henceforward and till Prabhupada departs".

**Note**: "Since when does the word "henceforward" mean: "hereafter and
until" (henceforward - *from now onwards* English dictionary).
Unbelievable but fact, these self-appointed gurus are ready to defend
their illegal position at any cost, even by making such an absurd
statements. Suppose we remove from the letter word "henceforward" still
nothing changes. The system of initiation installed by |SP|
four months before he left his body still remains. There is no further
instruction cancelling it. Without such a cancelation this letter should
be considered as final instruction on initiation matter.

**Nirandjana Svami continued, already crying aloud**: "Because no one
even wanted to think of |SP| departing. It was too painful
for his disciples. Why would we want to put it down on the paper:
“hereafter and until |SP| departs”. Therefore it was never
put like this. Because |SP| has given the law of disciple
succession in His instructions. It was in his letters, in His books and
lectures. So we didn’t put down in the letter: until |SP|
departures, because we didn’t want to think of it".

After small pause:

**Bhakta-das**: I do not want to argue with you.

**Niranjana Svami**: You cannot argue!

**Bhakta-das**: I won’t do it.

**Note**: Devotee was slightly shocked with such speculative speech of
Niranjana Maharaja and could not oppose him that moment. This is how
they delude devotees neophytes pressurizing and deluding them with mind
games, giving lie for the truth and like actors on the stage skillfully
*play the role* of love and devotion to their spiritual master.

In his speech Niranjana Maharaja directly insults |SP|
presenting Him as disable to execute some actions and carry
responsibility for His own actions. Niranjana Maharaja subjected the
directive of |SP| from July 9 1977 to derogatory
interpretation trying to present as the main acting person the secretary
Tamala Krishna Maharaja, who can be compared to the pen in the hand of
|SP|. Can really "pen" be independent from its master and
write what it wants?

Till the last second of his presence on the earth |SP| was
in clear and pure Krishna consciousness. Even in His Declaration of Will
he has written: “\ *I hereby make this Will in my full conscience and
with sound mind without any persuasion, force or ompulsion from
anybody.".*

However there appear such "so-called disciples" who try to show |SP|
as "disable", in order to justify their "*crime*" - illegal
position of *diksha-guru*.

In some sense we all in this material world are "criminals" since we
have gone against the will of God but those going against the will of
acharya the direct representative of God are *twice criminals.* The
greatness of |HDGSP| is immeasurable. In all
three worlds we will not find anyone greater or equal to Him. Such a
person comes to material world once in thousands of *kali-yugas*. And
only few really know who |SP| actually is.

Here is what He declares about Himself:

**"Only Lord Chaytanya can occupy my place. He will take care of this
movement".**

(|SP| conversation 2.11. 1977)

**Reporter**: Who will succeed you when you die?

**|SP|**: I will never die.

**Devotees**: *Jaya! Haribol*!

**|SP|**: I shall live from my books and you will utilise.

**Reporter:**\ Are you preparing a successor?

**|SP|:**\ Yes, it’s *my guru Maharaja*.

(|SP| Press Conference, 16th July 1975, San Francisco)

What kind of disciple one should be to dare after such statements of
|SP| to *occupy His place* – becoming a *Diksha-guru.*

The instructions of our acharya should be an immutable law for all of us
and never a subject for mind games. The disciple should fulfill them
without question with love and pride.

If we want to reach spiritual success, it is necessary for us to follow
the example of Ardjuna:

("Bhagavad-gita" verse 10.14.)
`sarvam <http://vedabase.net/s/sarvam>`__\ *etad*\ `ṛtaḿ <http://vedabase.net/r/rtam>`__\ `manye <http://vedabase.net/m/manye>`__\ `yan <http://vedabase.net/y/yan>`__\ `māḿ <http://vedabase.net/m/mam>`__\ `vadasi <http://vedabase.net/v/vadasi>`__\ `keśava <http://vedabase.net/k/kesava>`__.....

**"O**\ `Kṛṣṇa <http://vedabase.net/k/krsna>`__\ **, I totally accept as
truth all, that You have told me..."**

In the same way we should accept as the truth ― all instructions of
|SP|.

"Krishna and His representative are not different from each other".

Initially in this conversation Niranjana Svami has said to this devotee
that: “I didn’t do anything to prevent the relationship with |SP|,
I never destruct the relationship with |SP|.”

*This is not true!* As soon as devotee restores his relations with |SP|
and confesses to the ISKCON gurus that he accepts |SP|
as his *diksha-guru*\ there stars a “pressure”. For instance –
devotee is forbidden to visit the ISKCON temple. When Bhakta-das told
to Niranjana Svami that he communicates with |SP| and
receives His instructions *through His books and lectures.*

**Niranjana Svami**: But you can get mine that way?

**Bhakta-das**: I mean personally instructions. When you come you do not
give any instructions and do not show interest in my personal spiritual
life…

Here Niranjana Svami interrupted the devotee:

**Niranjana Svami**: "I’m still trying to understand you words, that you
get instructions from |SP| and do not get them from me.
*When did last time Prabhupada seat and spoke to you, and give you some
personal instructions*?"

**Note**: Bhakta-das has badly touched Niranjana Svami’s false EGO, so
that he started pressurizing him. It seems that for Niranjana Maharaja
|SP| is death. He is no more! If bona fide spiritual master,
direct representative of Supreme Personality of Godhead, is a common
person for Niranjana Maharaja and murti of |SP| is only a
piece of matter, may be Krishna is also no more for him and murti of the
Lord is only a piece of the metal or stone?

**|SP| says:** "One who considers the *arca-murti* or
worshipable Deity of Lord Vishnu to be stone, the spiritual master to be
an ordinary human being, and a Vaiṣṇava to belong to a particular caste
or creed, is possessed of hellish intelligence and is doomed."

(Dialectical spiritualism)

**"Never think that I am not with you, through my words, through
hearing, you contact me in reality**".

(Letter of |SP| to disciple 02.08.1967).

**"The influence of a pure devotee is such that if someone comes to
associate with him with a little faith, one gets the chance
of**\ **hearing**\ **about the Lord from**\ **authoritative
scriptures**\ **like
Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad Bhāgavatam …This
is the first stage of association with pure devotee.".**

("Nectar of Devotion" ch.19)

**"there are two kinds of association: physical and preceptorial.
Physical association is not so important as preceptorial
association.".**

(Letter of |SP| to Govinda dasi, 18.08.1969)

"**So we should associate by the vibration, and not by the physical
presence. That is real association."** (|SP|, lecture 18.08.
1968 Montreal)

Particularly through hearing the words of |SP| we contact
Him in reality. But as we are deluded by the false philosophy of
self-appointed gurus, we cannot correctly perceive the words coming
directly from Divine mouths of |SP|. The reason is that we
try to communicate with |SP| listening to Him by the agency
of such teachers, who’s self invented philosophy of
*guru-tattva*\ disagrees with *siddhanta*\ installed by |SP|.
Thereby they delude us regarding the true position of |SP|
and our relations with Him. Such "gurus" do not only shade
|SP| with themselves but also move us further and further
away from Him.

It seems that they are satisfied with remaining in such an "illusion"
about their own true position: "I am an eternal servant of Krishna". And
if I am a servant I must fulfill the will of my Master - the direct
representative of Krishna. This signifies that they should occupy
position of *shiksha-guru* and act in absolute accordance with the last
instruction of |SP| from (the July 9, 1977). *False ego* is
so powerful that forces them to act on their own whimsy pursuing
mercenary motives - prestige, glory, money, desire to dominate, control
others and a like. Being under influence of such *Maha-maya* they do not
even realize that in the end of the life they will be punished by Lord.

We continued our conversation:

**Bhakta-das**: "Can I ask you Maharaja? Do you lead disciples to the
God or to Prabhupada?"

**Niranjana Svami**: "That is what my disciples should understand"

**Bhakta-das**: "So I want to understand!"

**Niranjana Svami**: "That is for them to understand. *I never felt that
I'm such and exulted soul, that I have captured Krishna with full
prema".*

**Note**: Since Niranjana Svami was somewhat excited this looks like
revelation which was set free from the depth of his heart. After a small
pause he added on second thought:

"*If I’m supposed to be a Vaiṣṇava*\ I should not think like that.
*Vaiṣṇavas* don’t think like that: that with my prema I captured
Krishna. My disciples should see how much I’m follow Krishna’s
instructions, because that’s what Prabhupada said".

Audio recording of darshan with Niranjana Svami. Moscow 1999.

**Note**: *Vayshnava is* judged by his actions and deeds rather than his
skill of beautifully playing with words and imitating Great devotees.

Though Maharaja was not able to clearly answer the question of
Bhakta-das still the above stated shows with full evidence that all of
them occupy the position of *diksha-guru*\ illegally and they are not
representatives of Supreme Personality of Godhead, therefore they are
unable to bring their disciples back to God.

"One who cannot deliver his dependents from the path of repeated birth
and death should never become a spiritual master, a father, a husband, a
mother or a worshipable demigod." (S.B. 5.5.18).

*|SP| says*: "The duty of a guru is to rescue the living
entity from the new birth".

(Dialectical spiritualism)

We shall hope that reader will make right conclusions about how strictly
ISKCON gurus follow the instructions of |SP|. "Following" ―
is a process and even-though someone strictly follows this process it
does not yet signify that he is *Maha-bhagavata* or that |SP|
has asked him to initiate others.

*|SP| says*: "One who doesn’t follow the instructions of
one’s guru, cannot be a guru himself. If you stop obeying the guru, your
practice stops".

(Lecture of |SP| on Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 10 aug. 1974).

Аnd in Sri Caitanya-Caritamrita, commentary to Madhya-lila, 19.156 it is
said:

"The devotee must therefore be very careful not to commit offenses
against the spiritual master by *disobeying his instructions*. As soon
as one is deviated from the instructions of the spiritual master, the
uprooting of the
`bhakti <http://vedabase.net/b/bhakti>`__\ *-*\ `lata <http://vedabase.net/l/lata>`__
begins, and gradually all the leaves dry up".

This once again shows that unauthorized activities of the self-appointed
ISKCON gurus are doomed.

Niranjana Swami gave the instruction to set a *veto* for visiting the
temple on Bhakta-das. Self-appointed ISKCON gurus use any means to
suppress this kind of statements up to bodily harm of the one who wants
to surrender to |SP| as his *diksha-guru*. They all very
well realize that they are not able to bring their own disciples back to
God but it doesn’t keep them from going on accepting new disciples. This
is how Maya affects conditioned souls who are eager for enjoyments in
this material world. If we look at ISKCON “gurus” through the prism of
|SP|’s books and His instructions it becomes clear where do
they lead their disciples. To nowhere! To *samsara* - the cycle of
repeating lives and deaths in material world. All who occupy the
positions of *diksha-guru* on their own whimsy – are conditioned souls.
None of them is liberated soul. Realized soul acts according to his
spiritual nature. Pure devotee is not conditioned by gunas of material
nature and he would never go against instructions of *acharya*, *the
bona fide spiritual master staying in the chain of disciplic
succession*.

Worldwide ISKCON movement
============================================================================


In our *Gauḍiya-sampradaya,* chain of disciplic succession, which comes
from Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur, the only *diksha-guru*\ is 
His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada. He is *jagat-guru,*
that is to say guru for all of us. Some surrender and serve Him
willingly others do not do it straight. Just like some worship and serve
the Supreme Personality of Godhead and others serve His energy - Maya.
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur has said to his disciples before
leaving the material world:

**"Create GBC and co-operate. Wait and acharya will appear among you".**

But they did not follow His instructions and crudely braking the order
of their spiritual master started divided the property, vacant places
and choosing the new acharya. This undertaking ended with failure and
split Gauḍiya-math into two factions each of which brought forth its own
acharya. As a result both feuding camps became useless since they
disobeyed the order of their spiritual master in first place and thereby
lost the authority.

Being a representative of Krishna |SP| intentionally moved
aside from his ambitious Gauḍiya-math spiritual brothers and created a
new Worldwide Organization and named it ISKCON (INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF
KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS). Thereby he underlined their full non
authoritativeness. As a matter of fact, ISKCON is the real branch coming
from Lord Chaytanya. In other words ISKCON ― is a *true branch of
Gauḍiya-sampradaya* headed by the acharya-founder of International Society for Krishna Consciousnesses,
His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada.
All others are just branches (unauthorized gurus
acting on their own whimsy) growing aside from the main branch? As |SP|
said about them: "with the time they will dry up and fall
off, since they won’t get support and Grace from previous acharyas". Not
a single guru out of all *Gauḍiya-maths* except |SP| can be
a representative of Krishna and has an authority to be *diksha-guru* and
accept disciples. For this it is necessary to have *special authorities
and be*\ **siddha-purusha**\ *of the mantra which is given.*

|SP| sharply criticized his spiritual brothers for
disobeying the order of their guru, he used to say that they are useless
for preaching, needless to say for initiation.

Here is small fragment from (Sri Chaytanya-charitamrita Adi, ch.12.8.
the commentary.):

"Therefore, we do not belong to any faction. But because the two
parties, busy dividing the material assets of the
`Gaudiya <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/g/Gauḍiya>`__
`Matha <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/m/matha>`__ institution, stopped
the preaching work, we took up the mission of Bhaktisiddhanta
`Sarasvati <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/s/sarasvati>`__
`Thakura <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/t/thakura>`__ and Bhaktivinoda
`Thakura <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/t/thakura>`__ to preach the cult
of `Caitanya <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/c/caitanya>`__
`Mahaprabhu <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/m/mahaprabhu>`__ all over the
world, under the protection of all the predecessor acaryas, and we find
that our humble attempt has been successful. We followed the principles
especially explained by
`Srila <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/s/srila>`__ Visvanatha
`Cakravarti <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/c/cakravarti>`__
`Thakura <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/t/thakura>`__ in his commentary
on the Bhagavad-gītā verse
beginning *vyavasayatmika buddhir
ekeha*\ `kuru <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/k/kuru>`__\ *-*\ `nandana <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/n/nandana>`__.
According to this instruction of Visvanatha
`Cakravarti <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/c/cakravarti>`__
`Thakura <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/t/thakura>`__, it is the duty of
a disciple to follow strictly the orders of his spiritual master. The
secret of success in advancement in spiritual life is the firm faith of
the disciple in the orders of his spiritual master. The Vedas
[`SU <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/s/su>`__ 6.23] confirm this:

`yasya <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/y/yasya>`__\ `deve <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/d/deve>`__\ `para <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/p/para>`__\ *bhaktir*\ `yatha <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/y/yatha>`__\ `deve <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/d/deve>`__\ `tatha <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/t/tatha>`__\ `gurau <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/g/gurau>`__

*tasyaite kathita
hy*\ `arthah <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/a/arthah>`__\ *prakasante*\ `mahatmanah <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/m/mahatmanah>`__

"To one who has staunch faith in the words of the spiritual master and
the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the secret of success
in Vedic knowledge is revealed." The
`Krishna <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/k/krsna>`__ consciousness
movement is being propagated according to this principle, and therefore
our preaching work is going on successfully, *in spite of the many
impediments offered by antagonistic demons*, because we are *getting
positive help from our previous acaryas*. One must judge every action by
its result. *The members of the
self-appointed*\ `acarya <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/a/acarya>`__\ *'s
party who occupied the property of
the*\ `Gauḍiya <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/g/Gauḍiya>`__\ `Matha <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/m/matha>`__\ *are
satisfied, but they could make no progress in preaching. Therefore by
the result of their actions one should know that they
are*\ `asara <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/a/asara>`__\ *, or
useless*".

In spite of what |SP| speaks about of *Gaudya-math*
activities in "Chaytanya Charitamrita", some disciples of Narayana
Maharaja from *Gaudya-math* (we shall not mention their names for the
sake of humanism) declare that their spiritual masters just like |SP|
belong to the chain of disciplic succession coming from
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur. They *wrongly suppose* that it is
enough to get the initiation from *bona fide* spiritual master to
become\ *automatically* connected to *guru-parampara* and start
accepting disciples, who in turn are also *automatically* connected to
the same *parampara*. Such opinion prevails in majority of devotees from
both *Gaudya-maths* and ISKCON. This is a great *misconception*
suggested to us by unauthorized gurus. Here is an example:

If we are connected to the wire which in turn *is not connected* to the
main electric network what use does this wire make and all that is
connected to it? To be connected to the main electric network it is
necessary to have a *special permit from corresponding organs*.
Similarly to be in *guru-parampara* and accept disciples it is necessary
to get *special authorities from preceding acharya.*

"**One should take initiation from a**\ **bona fide**\ **spiritual
master coming in the disciplic succession, who is**\ **authorized by his
predecessor spiritual master**\ **. I his is
called**\ `dīkṣā <http://vedabase.net/d/diksa>`__\ **-**\ `vidhāna <http://vedabase.net/v/vidhana>`__".

(Shrimad Bhagavatam, 4.8.54 commentary)

"... **disciplic succession does not always mean that one has to be
initiated officially. Disciplic succession means to**\ **accept**\ **the
disciplic conclusion**."

(Letter of |SP| to Dinesh 31.10.1969)

The same disciples of Narayana Maharaja declare that N. Maharaja is
*Maha-bhagavata* representative of the spiritual world. And they
consider themselves a great pandits (scientists), pure devotees and say
that |SP| is *vartma-pradarshaka-guru*\ for them and thank
Him for directing them to bona fide spiritual master in *Gaudya-math*.
This kind of statements, are nothing but insult to the lotus feet of
|SP|.

Narayana Maharaja is a disciple of Bhaktipragiyana Keshava Gosvami a
Godbrother of |SP|. Here is what |SP| said
himself about His own Godbrothers:

" **Actually amongst my Godbrothers**\ **no one is qualified to become
acarya** [...] **instead of inspiring our students and disciples they
may sometimes pollute them** [...]**they are very competent to harm our
natural progress**".

(|SP| letter to Rupanuga from 28.04.1974)

Bhaktipragyana Keshava Gosvami Maharaja is not an exception in this
statement. The question comes: How could authorized Narayana Maharaja,
the Maha-bhagavata, representative of Lord Krishna *appear* from
unauthorized self-appointed guru like Bhaktipragiyana Keshava Gosvami
Maharaja? Is it really possible to become pure devotee worshiping the
conditioned soul? *Can mango fruits full of nectar*\ **appear**\ *on the
wild apple tree?*

By the will of providence the devotee Bhakta-das happened to have a
"pleasure" of short meeting with Narayana Maharaja. It happened
somewhere in 1996 - 97 in Mayapure, Bhakta-das was sitting on a sofa in
a hall of the longbuilding and didn’t notice how Maharaja took a seat
next to him. When Bhakta-das saw him he saluted and expressed his
respect to him. He immediately realized that this Maharaja is not from
ISKCON.

Narayana Maharaja asked him: "What is your name and where are you from?"
Even though Bhakta-das told his spiritual name Narayana Maharaja still
started inviting him to his *Gauḍiya-math* for *darshan* and class,
saying that they have a lot of Russian devotees too. Bhakta-das looked
straight into his eyes and said: "I am devoted only to Prabhupada!" This
was declared so expressively that Narayana Maharaja somewhat jumped back
and said: "Oh! very good, very good" and immediately disappeared.

Bhakta-das addressed one of the ISKCON devotees asking the name of this
Maharaja and got an answer that it was Narayana Maharaja from
*Gaudya-math*. That time such a system of *searching* for the disciples
was wide-spread in *Gaudya-maths*. Bhakta-das spent few years in
Mayapure and repeatedly got confirmation to it. By now, within last ten
years, they have gained great experience and professionalism in this
system of *searching out* disciples.

There turned out an opportunity for us to get acquainted with the book
of Narayana Maharaja "From living sadhu". Earlier we never read such
books published by *Gaudya-math,* because we understand very well what
this *Gaudya-math* is all about. But Krishna wished it and arranged so
that this book appeared in our hands. As we are writing a book about His
Divine Grace |SP|, therefore here we try to protect our
Gurudev from those cheaters, who claim to be an acharyas and ride
roughshod over |SP|, trying to get hold of His name, honor,
glory and His heritage.

So, we got attentively acquainted with the book of Narayana Maharaja
"From living sadhu" and we would like to state: this book – is an idle
speculation of Narayana Maharaja which contaminate devotees of ISKCON
and undermine the authority of the 
*acharya*-founder of International Society of Krishna Consciousnesses (ISKCON)
His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada.
In his book Narayana Maharaja states the
**body concept**\ *\ of "LIVING" guru* and disprove the
"*ritvik-system*" thereby indirectly accusing |SP| in
ineligibility of His actions.

We are far from liking this kind of "inquiry" but we have to do it in
order to protect our Gurudev |HDGSP|.
Therefore we shall bring only few examples revealing the truth for the
good of all.

Narayana Maharaja states that: "|SP| (supposedly) in the end
of His life several times asked Narayana Maharaja to kindly give his
association to Prabhupadas disciples after His death, to help them
understand the deeper truth of Vaiṣṇava philosophy in the Shrila Rupa
Gosvami Prabhupada’s lineage”.

Here Narayana Maharaja tries to lift his authority in the eyes of his
followers, telling them untruth about above brought talks. Dear readers,
later you will see confirmation to it.

Prabhupada says: "In my books the Philosophy of Krsna Consciousness is
explained **fully**, so if there is anything which you do not
understand, then you simply have to read again and again. By reading
daily **the knowledge will be revealed to you** and by this **process**
your spiritual life will develop ".

(Letter to Bahurupa 22.11. 1974.)

|SP| never says: address Narayana Maharaja.

Narayana Maharaja allows many interpretations as well as distorts
*shastras* where there is *diksha-guru*\ discussed, for instance: (B.g.
verse 4.34); (Mundaka Upanishad 1.2.12); (S.B., 11.2.21); (C.C.,
Adi.,1.32). Maharaja gives non authoritative scheme of *guru-parampara*
which differs from that given by |SP| in Bhagavad-gītā.
Narayana Maharaja brings forth his own speculations of
*diksha-guru*\ meaning, for instance he writes: "If our
*diksha-guru*\ is unable to free us from all the stages of the sins, it
is necessary to accept *shiksha-guru,*\ who has such might". This is
absolute *speculation.* If *diksha-guru*\ is unable to dispense from all
the stages of the sins then he is not *bona fide* *diksha-guru*.

|SP| says: "**The guru must be competent to lead his
disciple back home, back to Godhead**."

("Science of self-realization" ch.2)

Dear readers please take attentive look at the "Diksha" diagram which
you have already seen in the "DIKSHA Diagram" part.

Further Narayana Maharaja writes: "Some speak of accepting *diksha* by
means of audio-records of great personalities after they were gone". But
why not? If this has been installed by acharya - representative of
Supreme Personality of Godhead? Transcendental sound vibration of the
pure devotee recorded on audio-cassette is not different from Himself.
What means "some speak"? Further Narayana Maharaja writes again: "Some
speak that Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada has fixed *ritviks*\ to go on
giving *diksha* on His name. To accept this as a truth means to accuse
Srila Svami Maharaja that He was more ignorant *jagman* rather than bona
fide *guru*, who took help of *ritviks*, more experienced than He\ *, in
order to fulfill His own material desires or for the sake of perfection
in spiritual life*. But this is absolute lie because this is impossible.
On the way to the highest absolute reality, to Bhagavan, farfetched
concept of *ritvik-vada* is not practical and disagrees with the holy
scriptures".

Аnd in ISKCON journal from 1990 Narayana Maharaja declares: "We do not
follow any *ritvik-system*. In our *Gaudya-Vaiṣṇava* lineage there are
no *ritviks*. I have never come across a word "*ritvik*\ ” in our
*Vaiṣṇava* dictionary".

From above stated it follows that Narayana Maharaja does not accept the
authority of |SP| books and down grade the Prabhupada’s position.

The word *''ritvik'*\ (meaning 'priest')and its derivatives actually
have 32 separateReferences in |SP|'s books, only slightly
less than the word *diksa*\ and its derivatives, which has 41
separatereferences in |SP| books. Certainly, the use of
*ritviks-priests* to assist, in ceremonies is a concept fully sanctioned
in |SP|'s books:

**Ritvik:** 4.6.1. / 4.7.16 / 5.3.2 / 5.3.3 / 5.4.17 / 7.3.20 / 8.20.22
/ 9.1.15

**Rtvijah**: 4.5.7 / 4.5.18 / 4.7.27 / 4.7.45 / 4.13.26 / 4.19.27 /
4.19.28 / 4.19.29 / 5.3.4 / 5.3.15 / 5.3.18 / 5.7.5

/ 8.16.53 / 8.18.21 / 8.18.22 / 9.4.23 / 9.6.3

**Rtvijam**: 4.6.52 / 4.21.5 / 8.23.13 / 9.13.1

**Rtvigbhyah:** 8.16.55

**Rtvigbhih**: 4.7.56 / 9.13.3 /

(*All these references are from Shrimad-Bhagavatam*)

This *ritvik-system*, which Narayana Maharaja discusses here, came into
operation in 1975. |SP| used His representatives, accredited
devotees, for chanting on the malas and undertaking the ceremonies of
initiations both first and second, on His name. Later |SP|
named these representatives as "*ritviks*" and fixed their functions in
order from July 9 1977. For some reason that time Narayana Maharaja
never declared to |SP| that this "farfetched concept of
*ritvik-vada*" is not authoritative. And more than twenty years later
after |SP| left the world Narayana Maharaja suddenly
declares it even though this *ritvik-system* doesn’t function at the
moment. The question comes: why Narayana Maharaja got so much concerned
about something which, as a matter of fact, has even nothing to do with
him? The thing is that Narayana Maharaja occupies the same illegal
position of *diksha-guru*\ as ISKCON “gurus” do. They really do not want
this *ritvik-system* to be revived because all these self-appointed
gurus will lose their *guru-business.* This pushes them to sinful
actions.

In his book Narayana Maharaja accuses and humiliates the position of
|SP| hiding behind the words "some speak", as if it’s not
Narayana Maharaja who speaks, and hereon begins to abuse |SP|.
This is very bluffing policy "to create a phantom and
afterwards split it into fuzz and ashes". Although he writes: "*Some
speak..."* he knows well, better than most of us, that right before
departure |SP| installed “\ *Ritvik-system*\ ” in the
ISKCON, Society which He created. These\ *ritviks* (clergies) were to
act on behalf of *acharya* |SP| conducting *rituals of
initiation* both first and second.\ *Ritviks* do not give "*diksha*" and
do not free from any sins. This is a duty of *diksha-guru* - |SP|.

"*Ritvik-system*" installed by the *acharya*-founder |SP|
does not contradict with the shastras and this is confirmed by such a
great connoisseurs of the Sanskrit and philosophy as: Shri Shri
Rangapriya Svami Deshikachar as well as professor M.A. Tatachar you will
come to know about them in the following chapter.

In his book "From living sadhu" Narayana Maharaja writes: "I remember
another request. In the evening day before Swamiji left this world I saw
him last time, he was so good to me. He said: "*I have done something
wrong in my life* and I want everyone to forgive me. Specially. I want
you to forgive me since you served me and you are so dear to me". [...]
Then he told me: "forgive me and ask all my Godbrothers to forgive me
too. I have told to my disciples: do Not communicate with my
Godbrothers", *but this was in letter not in my books* and I have said
this only at a special moment".

Here again Narayana Maharaja speaks untruth, trying to humiliate the
position of |SP|. Narayana Maharaja admits the fact that
|SP| is Maha-bhagavata, pure devotee of the Lord, however
with his statements he puts |SP| into position of
conditioned soul who makes mistakes. Can pure devotee really make
mistakes and speak such words for which he would further have to ask for
forgiveness? |SP| – is *Maha-bhagavata* and each of His word
– is a word of God. We all know that Lord has granted Him with power to
fulfill this missions and words of such devotee are dictated by Lord
Himself. In Bhagavad-gītā 1-st Chapter the word Hrishikesha is used and
|SP| clearly says that Lord *directly* controls and manages
the feelings of pure devotee.

Regarding the letters we want to state that |SP| has written
not just a single but *several letters* to his disciples, where He
forewarned them from harmful contact with his brothers in God.

|SP| writes:

"**So**\ **I have now issued order**\ **that all my disciples should
avoid all of my godbrothers. They should not have any dealings with them
no even correspondence, no should they give them any of my books,
neither should you visit any of their temples. Please avoid them.**"

(Letter to Vishvakarma November 9 1975)

This is a very serious statement of |SP| "I have issued
order" and we have no rights to disagree with it. Within few years which
Bhakta-das spent in Mayapure he happened to communicate with devotees
from *Gaudya-maths*, he also had certain association with Maharajas and
therefore can say that he is well acquainted with the preaching which
*Gaudya-maths*\ carry out. Even now, after so many years, words of |SP|
do reflect the reality. To communicate on philosophical
subjects with devotees from *Gaudya-maths*, more so Maharajas is as
unfavorable as communication with *mayavadis*. The best communication
with them is to show them respect from as big distance as possible.
Their preaching, particularly that of Narayana Maharaja may seem to be
"sweetened nectar" for neophytes, but this "nectar" turns into poison in
the end just like milk touched by the snake.

|SP| had reason to speak about them in this way:

"**instead of inspiring our students and disciples they may sometimes
pollute them.** [...]**they are very competent to harm our natural
progress** ".

(|SP| letter to Rupanuga 28.04.1974)

"**So any of my godbrothers cannot help me in this way of book writing
because they are unfortunate in the matter of preaching work. They are
simply trying to infiltrate our society to do something harmful by this
attempt. So please do not have any correspondence with this Puri**\ **or
any of my godbrothers, so- called...**". (|SP|, letter to
Karune Sindhu, November 9 1975).

|SP| sharply convicts wrong activity of the *Gaudya-maths*
leaders. He doesn’t only forewarn His disciples in the letters, telling
the truth about His own Godbrothers, but also in His books **|SP| says**:
"... our preaching work is going on successfully, *in
spite of the many impediments offered by antagonistic demons*". Dear
readers, which demons do you think |SP| speaks about?
Further in the same chapter Prabhupada says: " *The members of the
self-appointed Acarya’s party who occupied the property of the Gauḍiya
Matha are satisfied, but they could make no progress in preaching.
Therefore by the result of their actions one should know that they
are*\ **asara,**\ *or useless*.”

(Sri Caytaniya Caritamrita Adi, ch.12.8. the commentary)

It’s not difficult to guess what *demons* the speech goes about here.
Leaders of *Gaudya-maths* were always envious about |SP|,
even before his departure to America. Prabhupada possessed outstanding
talent in the field of philosophy. With His wide knowledge He was
standing out against His Godbrothers. Due to envy they had for him, they
were not much enthusiastic to cooperate. Blind with envy none of them
could see the quality of pure devotee in Him and needless to say that
they couldn’t see that |SP| is an external manifestation of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And when He left for America nobody
could even imagine that |SP| will be a success, since many
of his Godbrothers already went to America before, for the preaching
purpose, and returned empty-handed. While being in America |SP|
repeatedly asked His co-brothers including Narayana Maharaja
to come to America and help him in preaching. Envy, which lived in their
hearts, and unbelief in success kept them from answering this
transcendental request. Hostile to him they could not allow and did not
want Prabhupada’s success since they were not able to achieve it
earlier. |SP|’s mercy is limitless to all conditioned souls
and He does not make any difference, demon or not demon, He wants
everyone to be occupied in service to Lord Krishna. Such are the
qualities of the greatest personality, pure devotee of the Lord!

In Sri Caytaniya Caritamrita (Adi, ch. 12.12. the commentary.) |SP| says:

"... Bhaktisiddhānta `Sarasvatī <http://vedabase.net/s/sarasvati>`__
`Ṭhākura <http://vedabase.net/t/thakura>`__ tried his best to spread the
cult of `Śrī <http://vedabase.net/s/sri>`__
`Caitanya <http://vedabase.net/c/caitanya>`__
`Mahāprabhu <http://vedabase.net/m/mahaprabhu>`__ to countries outside
India. When he was present he patronized the disciples to go outside
India to preach the cult of `Śrī <http://vedabase.net/s/sri>`__
`Caitanya <http://vedabase.net/c/caitanya>`__
`Mahāprabhu <http://vedabase.net/m/mahaprabhu>`__, but they were
unsuccessful because within their minds they were not actually serious
about preaching His cult in foreign countries; they simply wanted to
take credit for having gone to foreign lands and utilize this
recognition in India by advertising themselves as repatriated preachers.
Many svāmīs have adopted this hypocritical means of preaching for the
last eighty years or more, but no one could preach the real cult of
`Kṛṣṇa <http://vedabase.net/k/krsna>`__ consciousness all over the
world. They merely came back to India falsely advertising that they had
converted all the foreigners to the ideas of
`Vedānta <http://vedabase.net/v/vedanta>`__ or
`Kṛṣṇa <http://vedabase.net/k/krsna>`__ consciousness, and then they
collected funds in India and lived satisfied lives of material comfort.
As one fans paddy to separate the real paddy from useless straw, by
accepting the criterion recommended by
`Kṛṣṇadāsa <http://vedabase.net/k/krsnadasa>`__
`Kavirāja <http://vedabase.net/k/kaviraja>`__ Gosvāmī one can very
easily understand who is a *genuine world-preacher* and who is useless
".

How do you think, dear readers, why did Narayana Maharaja, as per his
words, go to America to visit holy places where |SP| used to
stay, only twenty years after Prabhupada left the world?

Presently ISKCON Society is undergoing a period of crisis, the ISKCON
leaders due to their strong material desires of the authorities,
glories, money, worship of themselves acted the same way as leaders of
*Gaudya-maths* have acted in their time ― went against instructions of
the *acharya*. This is the MAIN and the biggest reason for all the
troubles in ISKCON. Devotees who lost their faith in ISKCON gurus are
presently undergoing a big shock therapy and do not know what to
undertake, particularly after Harikesha Svami’s downfall. That’s why all
these absurd "reinitiations" and running from one false-guru to another
are going on. Narayana Maharaja is using these circumstances to snatch
control of such “runaways”. For this reason he has gone to the west, to
continue his indecent activity there. In their ignorance these
"runaways" have no idea that “\ *diksha-gurus*" from *Gaudya-maths* are
the same self-appointed gurus as ISKCON “gurus” are. They all have gone
against acharya – representative of Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Narayana Maharaja wouldn’t mind to also catch hold of all the rest of
|SP|’s disciples.

In Sri Ishopanishad ninth mantra it is said:

`andhaḿ <http://vedabase.net/a/andham>`__\ `tamaḥ <http://vedabase.net/t/tamah>`__\ `praviśanti <http://vedabase.net/p/pravisanti>`__\ `ye <http://vedabase.net/y/ye>`__\ *'*\ `vidyām <http://vedabase.net/v/vidyam>`__\ `upāsate <http://vedabase.net/u/upasate>`__

*tato*\ `bhūya <http://vedabase.net/b/bhuya>`__\ `iva <http://vedabase.net/i/iva>`__\ `te <http://vedabase.net/t/te>`__\ *tamo*\ `ya <http://vedabase.net/y/ya>`__\ `u <http://vedabase.net/u/u>`__\ `vidyāyām <http://vedabase.net/v/vidyayam>`__\ `ratāḥ <http://vedabase.net/r/ratah>`__

Translation: "Those who engage in the culture of nescient activities
shall enter into the darkest region of ignorance. Worse still are those
engaged in the culture of *so-called knowledge*".

Commentary: "This `mantra <http://vedabase.net/m/mantra>`__ offers a
comparative study of `vidyā <http://vedabase.net/v/vidya>`__ and
`avidyā <http://vedabase.net/a/avidya>`__.
`Avidyā <http://vedabase.net/a/avidya>`__\ *,* or ignorance, is
undoubtedly dangerous, but `vidyā <http://vedabase.net/v/vidya>`__\ *,
or knowledge, is even more dangerous when mistaken or misguided*."

In the same mantra, in the commentary |SP| says:

"One must approach a *bona fide* spiritual master in order to understand
the transcendental message of the Vedas. That is the direction of the
Muṇḍaka `Upaniṣad <http://vedabase.net/u/upanisad>`__
(`1.2.12 <http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/1/2/12/en>`__). These
`veda <http://vedabase.net/v/veda>`__\ *-*\ `vāda <http://vedabase.net/v/vada>`__\ *-*\ `rata <http://vedabase.net/r/rata>`__
people, however, *have their own ācāryas*, who are not in the chain of
transcendental succession. Thus they progress into the darkest region of
ignorance by misinterpreting the Vedic literature. They fall even
further into ignorance than those who have no knowledge of the Vedas at
all.”

For readers it will be obvious that activities of Narayana Maharaja are
very similar to the description in this *mantra*. He corresponds with
such
`veda <http://vedabase.net/v/veda>`__\ *-*\ `vāda <http://vedabase.net/v/vada>`__\ *-*\ `rata <http://vedabase.net/r/rata>`__\ who
gives his own interpretations of the holy scriptures misleading people.
Maharaja has *his own acharya* Bhaktipragiyana Keshava Gosvami Maharaja,
who does not belong to the\ *bona fide* chain of disciplic succession,
just like his other Godbrothers – they all went against instructions of
their *acharya* Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur, who told them:

"Create GBC and co-operate. Wait, acharya will appear among you".

All those who go against instructions of the *bona fide acharya*, not
through force of ignorance or inability to follow His instructions, but
the ones who do it consciously, are real *asuras*.

*|SP| says*: "The entire world is now full of many *asuras*
in the guise of politicians, **gurus**, **sadhus**, yogis and
incarnations".

(Shrimad Bhagavatam 10.3.21. commentary)

To go against *acharya* ― direct representative of Supreme Personality
of Godhead is equal to going against God Himself. As a matter of fact
*Gaudya-math* leaders act on their own whimsy and break the God’s law.
They do not belong to the *bona fide* chain of *Gaudya-sampradaya* and
act on their own, without accepting any authority. This kind of
*apasampradayas* cannot exist for long and if they don’t verge with the
Worldwide ISKCON Movemen, they will very soon cease to be. Some may say
that ISKCON has its own problems! And nevertheless *true*\ |SP|’s
followers can see that true ISKCON will be revived very
soon and *all false*\ will vanish in nowhere, it will be the way |SP| wants to see it.

**"Only Lord Caitanya can take my place. He will take care of the
Movement."**

(|SP|, conversation 2.11.1977)

Narayana Maharaja is committing a greatest sin by preaching distorted
philosophy and deluding unsophisticated people. Books by Narayana
Maharaja are meant for cheap public and neophytes, those who have never
received a proper formation from a **bona fide** spiritual master.

*|SP| says:* "Duty of a guru is to rescue the living entity
from the new birth".

(Dialectical spiritualism)

The interpreted knowledge received from self-appointed *guru*
contaminates devotee and becomes an obstacle on his path to achieving
the highest purpose ― returning back to God.

Dear readers we present for your attention an article about Narayane
Maharaja from "Back to Prabhupada" journal  №5 autumn 2004.

“The real” teaching of Narayana Maharaja
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



To many people both inside and outside the Movement, ISKCON's current
Guru system is a complete farce. Perhaps predictably, all the scandal,
falldowns and endless self-contradiction amongst |SP|'s
wannabe successors (the 80 competing ISKCON 'Gurus') has opened the way
for yet another personality, this time from outside ISKCON, with designs
on |SP|'s legacy. The GBC have preached for many years that
everyone must have a "living, physically present Guru" (or anyone but
|SP|), and now they are reaping their reward. His Holiness
Narayana Maharaja a disciple of |SP|'s Godbrother, His
Holiness Kesava Maharaja has had considerable success in attracting both
ex and current members of ISKCON to his camp, by promoting his
qualification as a "living, physically present Guru", who is bona fide
and won't fall down, unlike the ISKCON Gurus. Narayana Maharaja likes to
portray himself as a mere humble servant of |SP|, who simply
wants to bring everyone to |SP| through a deeper
appreciation of his mission and teachings:

"**You should know who your Prabhupada is. You should know. Then you can
glorify him, otherwise you cannot**."

(Narayana Maharaja, Los Angeles, May 31st, 2000)

In this article we shall use Narayana Maharaja’s own words to understand
weather he really brings us closer to |SP|.

Narayana Maharaja states that he is a successor of |SP|.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

He lets us see that he came and exists not for bringing people to |SP| but to actually become a substitute to |SP| as
His successor:

"I am the real successor of Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaja, and
there is no other."

(Narayana Maharaja, Murwillumbah, Australia, February 18th, 2002)

Here Narayana Maharaja boldly declares his rights in direct competition
with all ISKCON gurus to inherit the position or replace |SP|
rather than complement, assist or help Him. Narayana Maharaja
*directly competes* with |SP|.

In order to fulfill the above task – to replace |SP|,
Narayana Maharaja persisted that his followers should spread mainly his
books rather than |SP| one’s:

"Now Srila Gurudeva (Narayana Maharaja) has requested that we start what
he calls 'a second revolution' in preaching and book distribution. He
wants his books distributed in the same volume, 'not less than Swamiji
(|SP|).'"

(Gauḍiya Courier, Issue 15, July 1st, 2004)

It is clear that this goal - to compete with |SP| can only
be reached if his followers would spread books of N. Maharaja solely,
and this is what usually does occur.

“N. Maharaja states that |SP| has given only a foundation"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*To create a demand for his service*\ Narayana Maharaja states, that
there is a lot of spiritual knowledge which |SP| had no
time to give, so he can state that he has came to fill up this gap:

“So Svamiji has first cleared up the atmosphere. Has prepared the
ground, by preaching the holy name of Krishna and giving
**Gita-sandesh.**

This was a very important work. He has done this work and that was so
much required for the whole world. But having done this He didn’t do the
whole. This was only a foundation. He wasn’t able to finish up this
work".

(Lecture of N. Maharaja 19 September 1994)

Narayana Maharaja assured that |SP| did not give all.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The fact that above given utterance of Narayana Maharaja is false can be
even proved by the words of Narayana Maharaja himself which he said 17
year earlier to |SP|:

**"All your duties are fulfilled. You have done all in your life. There
is no need to worry about anything else. Yes, you have done all, nothing
is left undone".**

(Translation of the conversation on Bengali between N. Maharaja and
|SP| which took place in oct-nov. 1977. *Supplied by the N.
Maharaja followers*).

The fact that Narayana Maharaja dared to say absolutely opposite to what
he himself stated 17 years back, demonstrates *an extreme opportunism*.

Narayana Maharaja states that |SP| is not a founder-acharya of ISKCON.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This opportunism was later shown in Narayana Maharaja’s statement that
|SP| was not an acharya-founder of ISKCON.

Of cause Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu is a source of the Krishna
Consciousness therefore it is at least strange why would N. Maharaja
pays such an importance to minimizing the role of |SP| and
supporting his own position by stating such obvious things:

"You must also know that Caytanya Mahaprabhu is a founder of ISKCON.
Svamiji was only one of the prominent acharyas in this line. He is not a
founder.”

(N.Maharaja 28April 1999, Karakas, Venezuela)

"Your |SP| has only changed the name to English. He is not
an acharya-founder, this is eternal ISKCON. **I am ISKCON. I am not
different from ISKCON. I am Bhaktivedanta**"

(Shrila Bhaktivedanta Narayana Gosvami Maharaja)

“Like father, like son. I am the real successor of Srila Bhaktivedanta
Swami Maharaja, and there is no other. You should know this very openly.
I am Bhaktivedanta and he is Bhaktivedanta, but he received this name
after I did. I'm senior to him in this regard. I'm Bhaktivedanta, and
I'm also ISKCON. Don't think that I'm out of ISKCON." (Narayana
Maharaja, Murwillumbah, Australia February 18 2002).

*But according to |SP|*: "**I am an acharya-founder of the
International Society of Krishna Consciousnesses**" (|SP|,
letter to Bigelov, Allahabad January 20 1971).

Narayana Maharaja deviates from |SP| - 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although he claims to be a successor to |SP|, and that |SP|
is somehow speaking through him, it should be noted that
Narayana Maharaja's teachings often seriously differ from |SP|'s.
This is what Narayana Maharaja has to say about Prahlada
Maharaja, who is worshipped on every altar throughout ISKCON as a
completely pure devotee of Krishna: "Prahlada Maharaja was a very bona
fide bhakta, and he never wanted anything worldly, but he could not
serve Krishna. His bhakti was mixed with jnana, knowledge of the Lord's
opulence. If you have some worldly desire, or any desire, then your
bhakti may be sanga-siddha bhakti or aropa-siddha bhakti, but not pure
transcendental bhakti".

(Narayana Maharaja, Hawaii 17 febr. 2001)

"Prahlada Maharaja is the topmost example of a Vaisnava".
(Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 4.21.47, purport)

"So we see practically how Prahlada Maharaja immediately attained the
state of prema… he first of all followed the instruction of Brahma, then
immediately he got the favor of Lord Nrsimhadeva, and after getting that
he got the prema state."

(|SP| lecture, Mayapur, February 14th, 1976)

"`Prahlāda <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/p/prahlada>`__
`Mahārāja <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/m/maharaja>`__ was offered all
the blessings of an opulent position in the material world and even the
liberation of merging into
`Brahman <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/b/brahman>`__, but he refused all
this. He simply wanted to engage in the service of the servant of the
servant of the Lord. " (Shrimad Bhagavatam 5.24.25).

Above we see Prahlada Maharaja described as a pure devotee who actually
shunned the results of jnana (knowledge).

**Deviation-2**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Narayana Maharaja claims that Advaita Acarya (one of the associates of
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu) was incapable of giving people Vraja-Bhakti
(pure devotion to Krishna):

"Sri Advaita Acarya...He is a part of the part of the part of the part
of Krishna. Being so far away, He can preach with kirtana, but He cannot
give Vraja-bhakti. Never. He is not qualified for this. Only Krishna can
do this." (Narayana Maharaja, Los Angeles, California May 31, 2000)

Contrast the above with the following verse from the Sri Caitanya
Charitamrta as presented by |SP|:

"He (Advaita Acharya) delivered all living beings by offering the gift
of Krishna-bhakti (pure devotion to Krishna). He explained Bhagavadgita
and Śrīmad Bhāgavatam in the light of devotional service."

(|SP|, Caitanya caritamrita, Adi-lila 6.28)

Thus Narayana Maharaja again disagrees with the siksa (instruction)
given by |SP|, even though he also rather immodestly claims
to be his "dearmost siksa disciple".

Narayana Maharaja has claimed that |SP| ordered him to
instruct |SP|'s disciples:

"He ordered me, 'Help my disciples' [...] You can get that
cassette.[...] If anyone does not have belief in my statements, he can
acquire and hear the cassette. At the time he spoke in Bengali so that
others would not understand."

(Salt Spring Island, Canada, April 2001, pm)

This claim is based on |SP| stating "you kindly instruct
them on this matter" to Narayana Maharaja, during a Bengali conversation
spoken between the two sometime in October-November 1977.

However, as will be seen from the full translation of this conversation
provided by the Narayana Maharaja camp themselves, |SP| does
not say anything of the sort. Whilst reading the relevant portion of the
conversation below, please pay special attention to whom the word "them"
in the above sentence refers to; what was the "matter" on which |SP|
wanted Narayana Maharaja to give instruction; and "when" this
instruction was meant to be given:

**|SP|**: Are any of my god-brothers in Vrindavana now?

**Narayana Maharaja**: Yes.

**|SP|:** Who?

**Narayana Maharaja**: Van Maharaja might be there, as well as Indupati
Prabhu from Caitanya Gauḍiya Matha.

**|SP|**: Any more?

**Narayana Maharaja**: Only these two at the moment.

**|SP|**: Who is Indupati?

**Narayana Maharaja**: Indupati. He comes here often.

**Bhakticaru Swami**: From Madhava Maharaja's matha?

**Narayana Maharaja**: Yes. No one else is here.

**|SP|**: Please call both of THEM. Van Maharaja and him.

**Narayana Maharaja:** This is very good proposal by you.

**|SP|:** Please sit down. They will call THEM.

**Narayana Maharaja**: All right.

**|SP|:** This cutting of arguments happens sometimes...

**Narayana Maharaja**: These are insignificant matters in such a
substantial worldwide mission. A little something here and there is of
no consequence. You have done this wonderful preaching work for the
benefit of the whole world. There was no self-interest. You did
everything only in devotional service to Krsna - for benefiting all
people at large.

**|SP|:** It is all by your blessings.

**Narayana Maharaja:** You have done a wonderful thing. It is necessary
to care for and preserve this mission, and see that it is managed
skilfully.

**|SP|**: YOU KINDLY INSTRUCT THEM ON THIS MATTER. I'm
unable to speak

1) Word "them" refers to |SP|’s Godbrothers who were to
arrive shortly. And this has nothing to do with |SP|’s
disciples as Narayana Maharaja tries to present.

2) Word "them" is twice used in the conversation and in both cases
refers to |SP|’s Godbrothers: Indupati and Van Maharaja.

3) "Matter" on which |SP| asked N. Maharaja to give
instructions to his Godbrothers concerns the apologies for "cutting of
the arguments" which He could have allowed in His preaching activity.

4) And when was this instruction to be given? There and then only. Right
after asking N. Maharaja to give the instructions |SP|
immediately states: "I'm unable to speak" That is why he asks N.
Maharaja to explain these matter to his Godbrothers as soon as they
arrive.

5) So here we clearly see a false claim made by Narayana Maharaja to
promote his agenda as being the "real successor" to |SP|.

In conclusion, on the basis of all the above, it is clear from Narayana
Maharaja's OWN WORDS that he is not simply a "dearmost siksa disciple"
of |SP| whose aim is to help to bring us closer to |SP|.
Rather he is no different to the 80 wannabe "successor
Gurus" of ISKCON, doing and saying whatever is necessary to jockey for
|SP|'s position.

The End.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Narayana Maharaja tries to get hold of the Prabhupada’s name, His honor,
glory and heritage. And thereby cause harm to the Mission of Krishna
Consciousness Movement, the cradle of the World Spiritual Revolution.

Narayana Maharaja and ISKCON gurus play the same game, but each wants to
extract its own MOTIVE from it.

"Anyone against the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees is
called a *demon.”*

(Shrimad Bhagavatam 9.5.6. commentary)

*|SP| says*: "*Shiksha-guru*, who gives the instructions
contradicting to the instructions of the spiritual master, is not true
*shiksha-guru*. This is *demon...* *Shiksha-guru* cannot give the
instructions, contradicting with the instructions of diksha-guru. This
not shiksha-guru. This rascal".

(Lecture on Bhagavad gita, Hong Kong, July 4 1974)

**|HDGSP| is -**\ **jagat-guru**\ **that is to
say guru for the whole world.**

"In (Mundaka Upanishad 1.2.12) it is said:

   *tad-vijnanartham sa gurum evabhigacchet*

   *samit-panih srotriyam brahma-nistham*

**"In order to learn the transcendental science, one must approach the
bona fide spiritual master in disciplic succession, who is fixed in the
Absolute Truth."**

Thus it has been enjoined herewith that in order to receive that
transcendental knowledge, one must approach the guru. Therefore, if the
*Absolute Truth is one*, about which we think there is no difference of
opinion, *the guru also cannot be two*. The Acaryadeva for whom we have
assembled tonight to offer our humble homage is not the guru of a
sectarian institution or one out of many differing exponents of the
truth. On the contrary, he is the *Jagad-guru*, or the guru of all of
us; the only difference is that some obey him wholeheartedly, while
others do not obey him directly."

(Science of self-realization ch. 2)

In this chapter |SP| reveals the importance and need of
accepting the **bona fide** guru very well. He emphasizes that **bona
fide** guru is ONE. The reason for our misunderstanding of this
important aspect is that we do not address our *acharyadeva* |SP|
directly but through mediators – false-gurus or those who
consider themselves as high as "*jagat-guru".* This is why it is so
difficult to understand the philosophy given in His books and as a
consequence we fall victim of deceit.

*|SP| says*: "If you want a cheap guru, or if you want to be
cheated, then you will find many cheating gurus. But if you are sincere,
you will find a sincere guru. ".

(“Science of Self-Realization” ch. 2)

Since the times of |SP|, antagonistic followers of
self-appointed acharyas from Gaudya-maths are creating obstacles to our
Society. They disobeyed their spiritual master and now render the
negative influence upon ISKCON devotees. With their preaching they
derogate the true position of |SP|.

|SP|’s words about His Godbrothers:

"My Guru Maharaja used to say, *prana arthe yanra sei hetu pracara*.
"One who has got life, he can preach." The dead man cannot preach. So
you become with life, not like dead man. Without life ..\ *Just like all
my godbrothers*. *They are dead men*. And therefore they are envious of
my activities. They have no life. If you want to make easy-going life,
showing the Deity and then sleep, then it is a failure movement."

(|SP| July 13 1974г. Los-Angeles)

And here is what |SP| thought himself of some of the
acharyas of this sort.

“\ **Bhakti Vilas Tirtha is very much antagonistic to our Society and he
has no clear conception of devotional service. He is contaminated.”**

(|SP| Letter to Sukadeva, 14/11/73)

**“Regarding Bhakti Puri, Tirtha Maharaja, they are my Godbrothers and
should be shown respect. But you should not have any intimate connection
with them as they have gone against the orders of my Guru Maharaja.”**

(|SP| Letter to Pradyumna, 17/2/68)

"In the latter days of my Guru Maharaja he was very disgusted. Actually,
he left this world earlier, otherwise he would have continued to live
for more years. Still he requested his disciples to form a strong
Governing body for preaching the cult of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He never
recommended anyone to be *acarya*\ of the *Gauḍiya Math*. But *Sridhara
Maharaja* is responsible for disobeying this order of Guru Maharaja, and
*he* and others who are already dead unnecessarily thought that there
must be one *acarya*. If Guru Maharaja could have seen someone who was
qualified at that time to be acarya he would have mentioned. Because on
the night before he passed away he talked of so many things, but never
mentioned an acarya. His idea was talked of so many things, but never
mentioned an *acarya*. His idea was acarya was not to be nominated
amongst the governing body. He said openly you make a GBC and conduct
the mission. So his idea was amongst the members of GBC who would come
out successful and self effulgent *acarya* would be automatically
selected. So *Sridhara Maharaja* and his two associate gentlemen
unauthorizedly selected one *acarya* and later it proved a failure.
[...] Actually **amongst my Godbrothers no one**\ **is qualified to
become**\ *\ *\ **acarya**."

(|SP|, letter Rupanuge from 28.04. 74)

**“So as soon as one thing is three times stressed, that means final.”**

(|SP| Bg. Lecture, 27/11/68, Los Angeles)

Our ISKCON “gurus” have made, put it mildly, the same "*fault*", as
leaders of *Gaudya-maths* in their time. They have gone against the will
of our *аcharya* |SP| and occupy the same kind of illegal
position of *diksha-guru*. This duet can be compared to *false coin*.
One side of the false coin - self-appointed gurus of *Gaudya-maths* and
on the other side - self-appointed gurus of ISKCON. No one of these
spiritual masters, performing role of *diksha-gurus* is a representative
of Krishna. To go against the will of *acharya* is equal to going
against the God’s will. This is madness. How would they be able to bring
their disciples back home to God if the road to the Spiritual World is
closed for them in this life!

|SP| gives nice description of the consequences of the
activity of such spiritual masters:

“By a false display of religious sentiments, they present a show of
devotional service while indulging in all sorts of immoral activities.
In this way they pass as spiritual masters and devotees of God. Such
violators of religious principles have no respect for the authoritative
**acaryas**, *the*\ **holy teachers**\ *in the strict disciplic
succession*. They ignore the Vedic injunction acaryopasana -- "One must
worship the `acarya <http://vedabase.net/a/acarya>`__" -- and
`Krsna <http://vedabase.net/k/krsna>`__'s statement in the
Bhagavad-gītā (4.2)
`evam <http://vedabase.net/e/evam>`__
`parampara <http://vedabase.net/p/parampara>`__-`praptam <http://vedabase.net/p/praptam>`__,
"This supreme science of God is received through the disciplic
succession." Instead, to mislead the people in general they themselves
become so-called *acaryas*, but they do not even follow the principles
of the *acaryas*.

These rogues are the most dangerous elements in human society. Because
there is no religious government, they escape punishment by the law of
the state. They cannot, however, escape the law of the Supreme, who has
clearly declared in the Bhagavad-gītā
that envious demons in the garb of religious propagandists shall be
thrown into the darkest regions of hell (`Bg.
16.19-20 <http://vedabase.net/bg/16/19/en2>`__).
`Sri <http://vedabase.net/s/sri>`__ Isopanisad confirms that these
pseudo religionists are heading toward the most obnoxious place in the
universe after the completion of their spiritual master business, which
they conduct simply for sense gratification.”

Sri Isopanishad (mantra 12, commentary)

In this commentary |SP| strongly convicts the
pseudo-religious man, preaching impersonalizm and worship of demigods.
Hereinafter, in the commentary |SP| describes their
*qualities*, *actions* and the *consequences*. Even though our
unauthorized gurus preach Krishna Consciousness but their *qualities*
and *actions* perfectly correspond to this description. They are also
involved into motivated devotional service, make amoral actions and
break religious principles. They also *do not accept the authority of
acharya* in the chain of disciplic succession and delude devotees
proclaiming themselves a *diksha-guru* without any blessing from above.

To accept disciples diksha-guru *must* be a **Maha-bhagavata** (the most
top stage of the God realization) and be
*specially*\ **accredited**\ *by his spiritual master*. |SP|
always strictly convicted appropriation of a *guru* status to oneself by
those who have no due qualities and authority for this.

Here is the only fragment from |SP|'s books where the term
*diksa (diksitah)*\ is linked with a specific qualification:

**Maha-bhagavata**\ *-srestho brahmano vai gurur nrnam*

   *sarvesam eva lokanam asau pujyo yatha harih*

*maha-kula-prasuto' pi sarva-yajnesu*\ **diksitah**

   *sahasra-sakhadhya yi ca na guruh syad avaisnavah*

**"The guru must be situated on the topmost platform of devotional
service. There are three classes of devotees, and the guru must be
accepted from the topmost class."**

**"When one has attained the topmost position of maha-bhagavata, he is
to be accepted as a guru and worshipped exactly like Hari, the
Personality of Godhead. Only such a person is eligible to occupy the
post of a guru."**

(C.c. Madhya, 24.330, purport)

|SP| also says that before acting as a *diksha-guru* besides
the necessary qualification one should get special authorization from
previous *acharya:*

**"On the whole, you may know that he is not a liberated person,
and**\ **therefore**\ **, he cannot initiate any person to Krsna
Consciousness. It requires**\ **special spiritual benediction**\ **from
higher authorities."**

(S.P. Letter to Janardana, 26/4/68)

**"One should take initiation from a bona fide spiritual master coming
in the disciplic succession, who is**\ **authorised by his predecessor
spiritual master**\ **. This is called**\ **diksa-vidhana."**

(S.B. 4.8.54, purport)

*We can only wonder, how powerful is a desire of the living being to
enjoy in this material world. All want to occupy the position of God.
But, alas!*\ **This place is already occupied.**

**"The guru is one because he comes in disciplic succession."**
("Science of Self-Realization" ch. 2).

"**If everyone just initiates then there will be contradictory result.
As long as it goes on, there will be only failure".**

(|SP| Phalgun Krishnan Pancami, verse 23)

*Shiksha-guru* – is also a spiritual master, there can be hundreds and
thousands of them but *diksha-guru* is ONE. Lord Caytanya was calling
for: "*āmāra ājñāya guru hañā*" become *shiksha-guru* but not *diksha*.

**The duty of**\ **diksha-guru**\ **― is to bring the conditioned souls,
who have surrendered to Him, back home to God.**

Anyone who tries to occupy the position of *diksha-guru* on his own
whimsy is in illusion about their true position. This is a last trap of
Maya. Our position is the one of the servant rather than master. If
devotee goes against instructions of the acharya he deprives himself a
possibility to return to the spiritual world.

We are unable to fully realize the infinite Greatness of |HDGSP|
with our material mind. His appearance on this
planet is unique and inimitable. There is no one grater or equal to Him
in this world. Such a personality comes to material world once in a
thousands of *Kali-yugas*. And only few know who |SP|
actually is. When His disciples asked: "|SP|, who are you?"
- He answered: "If I tell you, you won’t believe!"

His Mission is a continuation of the Lord Caytania Mahaprabhu’s play.
The real assignment of the |SP|’s phenomena – is to make
come true the desire and prediction of Lord Caytania Mahaprabhu. **"In
each city and each village people will sing the holy name of the
Lord".**\ For this purpose |SP| has founded a Worldwide
Movement of ISKCON, which will be headed by Him as a **bona fide**
spiritual master for the period of ten thousand years. His Mission is to
make the whole world to realize Krishna and bring back to God those
conditioned souls who are devoted to Him. And nobody is able to disturb
this Great Mission of *Saṅkīrtana*, commenced by Lord Caytania.

**"Only Lord Caitanya can take my place. He will take care of the
Movement."**

(|SP|, conversation 2.11.1977)

*|SP| says*: "The
`sańkīrtana <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/s/sankirtana>`__ movement is
important, for regardless of whether one is a
`śūdra <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/s/sudra>`__,
`vaiśya <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/v/vaisya>`__\ *,*\ `mleccha <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/m/mleccha>`__\ *,*\ `yavana <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/y/yavana>`__
or whatever, if one associates with a **pure devotee**, follows **his**
instructions and serves the **pure devotee**, his life is successful.
This is `bhakti <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/b/bhakti>`__."

(S.B., 7.15.73. commentary)

This is our task as |SP|’s devotees and followers to help
Him in realization of his mission, unfailingly execute all edifications
and instructions of our *acharya*, surrender and accept each of His word
as a\ **truth.**\ To participate in this mission is a great Mercy for us
and we must not miss it, otherwise we risk to find ourselves out of this
great ship - VAYKUNTHA.

Self-appointed gurus of *Gaudya-math* vastly exceed unauthorized ISKCON
gurus in the art of interpreting |SP|’s philosophy. Exactly
for this reason among ISKCON devotees last years there occurred a
tendency of tempestuous transition to *Gaudya-maths*. They are hoping to
find a bona fide spiritual master there. Leaders of self-appointed
*acharyas* from *Gaudya-maths* are unable to create their own good
devotees and concern only with enticing readymade devotees. Actually,
all, who are attracted to the Krishna consciousness movement through
|SP| books are disciples of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada.
And those who assigns such disciples to
himself, whoever he is and whatever social position he has, is a *cheater*.

Unfortunately, many devotees judge the spiritual level of the person
only by external signs and on this base move over to other *Maths* in
quest of a *guru*.

Let us bring an example from Śrīmad Bhāgavatam:

"A person's spiritual position will be ascertained merely according to
external symbols, *and on that same basis people will change from one
spiritual order to the next. A person's propriety will be seriously
questioned if he does not earn a good living. And one who is very clever
at juggling words will be considered a learned scholar*." (S.B., 12. 2.
4.)

After some time majority of devotees who moved to *Gaudya-math*, reap
the fruits of disappointment. There is an example of one devotee with
whom we had a conversation on this topic. We mean Bhakti-vedanta
Raddhanti Maharaja, former Ananta-shaya das. He has said: *"I always
remembered about |SP|, chanted His pranama, worshipped and
even conducted puja for Him*". That’s why he was shed a mercy of |SP|
in form of reasonable inspiration. He returned to ISKCON,
although he came under GBC’s "wing", still this is already a first step
back to Prabhupada. We shall hope that this will serve a good example
for his congeners from *Gaudya-maths*...

Time will come when all these leaders of *Gaudya-maths* will accept
|SP| as the Greatest *acharya*, the *bona fide* spiritual
master in the chain of true disciplic succession and will **JOIN this
Worldwide ISKCON Movement**!

In *Gaudya-sampradaya* there is ONE **bona fide** *guru* ― 
His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada and all rest occupy the
position of *non authoritative gurus* who have never brought anyone back
to God.

Dear devotees, please, do not waist you precious human life on this
useless gurus. Let's throw off the shroud of illusions from our trustful
and naive eyes and we will see the *true* way leading to the spiritual
world.

*|SP| says:* "**Mahajana – is ONE and straight way to in
transcendental world is also one**"

"The Science of Self Realization" ch. 2)

We sincerely pray to Lord Krishna and |SP| for their Grace
to condescend into your kind hearts. Only uniting all together we shall
be able to put an end to the great deceit of unauthorized ISKCON gurus
who follow the way of fraud, violence’s and prohibitions.

*|SP| says*: "**Krishna and Society of Krishna are not
different. Taking care of the Krishna Society devotee will never forget
about Krishna**".

(Dialectical spiritualism)

Therefore the closer and more united we become, as a good family the
easier it will be for us to approach Krishna.

We address all devotees of ISKCON, as well as devotees of *Gaudya-maths*
and all sincere souls in who’s lives |SP| has a special
place. Please, try to understand that this important transcendental and
very urgent topic is directed on one purpose only, ― to restore the
essential position of |SP| as a single *Diksha-guru* and
high authority for the whole International Movement of Krishna
consciousness and help all devotees to return back to lotus feet of
|SP|. If we don’t surrender oneself to |SP| and
follow unauthorized gurus, there is no even a smallest chance for us to
reach the highest perfection and *return home, back to God.* It can be
reached only by grace of |SP| and Sri Krishna.

If we return back to lotus feet of |SP| our spiritual life
will be filled with true sense. We are all brothers and sisters of one
big family. We have one God ― KRISHNA and ONE ― **bona fide** spiritual
master ― *Acharya*-founder of International Society of Krishna
consciousnesses His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada.

**Interview with Sri Bannanje Govindacarya**
============================================================================

It may be recalled that HG Vidvan Gauranga Dasa posted a report of his
meeting two eminent Vaiṣṇava in Bangalore, namely Vidyavacaspati Sri
Bannaje Govindacharya (a grhasta madhva scholar). When devotees of
ISKCON Bangalore showed the report to Sri Bananje Govindacharya, he said
that the reporting was partial and did not completely represent his
views. The devotees continued their discussion with him and it was
recorded. Later the interview was transcribed, taken back to him for
review so that he is satisfied that we represent his views properly this
time. We provide the same here.

Below is an interview with Sri Bannanje Govindacarya, original tape
available:

**Sri Bannanje Govind**\ **acarya**\ **:**\ Meaning of *diksha* is to
give *adhikara* in a *mantra* or any system or in a faith. Who can give
initiation? In fact if I want to initiate somebody into *gayatri*, I
must be a realised person. *Gayatri sakshatkara* is the first
requirement for a *diksha-guru*. Siddhi or perfection. *Mantra siddhi*.
Otherwise one cannot give *mantra* *diksha* to others, according to
*shastra*. So simply giving *diksha* and canceling and taking again
another *diksha* - that is all ashastric, not according to *shastra*...
So this is the problem when we institutionalize a faith. We have to face
all these problems, because when you institutionalize faith then all the
institutional and organizational problems enter and all the
organizational problems will come. Actually according to *shastra*, none
of these swamis can initiate... No swami unless he has attained
*sakshatkar* or *mantra* *siddhi* he cannot initiate. That is
what....told was correct. Unless he has that power to take the *sishya*
into that height, that elevation, initiation becomes a mere mechanical
procedure. It has no meaning. If I want to initiate you I must be able
to bring you to that plane and you must be able to meditate upon that
mantra and that power should be given. *Initiation is not mere
mechanical procedure.*\ **That is a transformation of a power, mantric
and spiritual power**. And a person who has actually no spiritual power
how can he give spiritual power to a *sisya*? It cannot be claimed by a
mere post or institutional powers. Initiation is totally different

ISKCON devotee: The point is the 11 *ritvik*\ s, only on the assumption
that Prabhupada is not on the planet they stopped continuing to be
*ritvik*\ s. Is that correct or wrong? We are saying, " you don't have
an explicit order. A clear order of the *acharya* is needed to become a
*diksha-guru*. |SP| made a system-you stopped the
*acharya*'s order!" We are questioning. They are not able to justify
that. So are they correct in their justification or wrong?

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: No...do they claim that they are no more
*ritviks*?

ISKCON devotee: They say that they are no more *ritvik*\ s. They are
regular gurus. Regular gurus means, as I told you the definition,
according to |SP|'s teachings, it is very serious thing. It
is a very big thing.

**Sri Bannanje Govindacarya:** Yes. See that is why I have told this is
clash between the organization and the spiritual practice. When the
spiritual practices become institutionalized, then the institution has
certain... it is totally left to the ...you are correct. There is no
letter or there is no resolution, any orders. In an institution anything
can be changed. The governing body is there and by majority they can
vote and they can have a resolution. They can change anything. According
to rules and regulations. But that is left to the organizational rules
and regulations. That is what I have told, according to *shastra*, the
religious or spiritual part of *diksha* - giving *diksha*, a person who
has *siddhi* – *sidha-purusa* can give *diksha* to others. Otherwise it
has no meaning at all. *It is not a mechanical thing.*

ISKCON devotee: So their another argument is that because it is not
normal, according to tradition just like son becomes father, it is
natural. So naturally disciple becomes guru. This is also natural. So we
have become gurus. So if we follow *ritvik*, because it is non
traditional, not in the *sampradaya*, we stopped practicing it. Is it
really *apasampradaya*? To follow *acharya*'s ajna?

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: Is it *apasampradaya* means here in other
sampradayas, particularly in the *Vaiṣṇava sampradaya* or the *madhva
mutts*, their *mantra diksha* is to be taken by a living guru. It is a
tradition. Strictly speaking, *diksha* even here when a swami gives
*mantra* or upadesha to a disciple, the inner concept is that the living
guru is not the real guru. *Madhvacharya* is there in his body and
through living guru the spirit, actually the original spirit of
*Madhvacharya*, the original spirit of living guru that is what is
functioning. That concept is there. But a *diksha* living guru is a must
in tradition. It is there. That is why they say *apasampradaya*. See in
all other sampradayas *diksha-swekara* from a living guru is generally
accepted in all... see it is in practice even in *Madhva mutt*.

ISKCON devotee: So Prabhupada appointed these *ritvik*\ s to do the
external aspects of the *diksha*, like gving mala, spiritual name, etc
These are to be done through a living *ritvik*\ s. So *ritvik*\ s are
living. But the roles are defined and the real aspect of the *diksha*,
giving transcendental knowledge and taking the responsibility of
delivering the disciple, Prabhupada continues to do it. In that sense is
it *apasampradaya*?

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: No we cannot say that. Because what is
*sampradaya*? *Sampradaya* is again a constitution- a spiritual
institution. And it is followed by centuries and centuries by the
*sisyas*. So any system that is in practice for more than 100 years, it
becomes *sampradaya*!

ISKCON devotee: Now since no *acharya* in the past has formed an
international society...

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: Yes, that is why I have told you,
*sampradaya* means also, it is a spiritual constitution, which should
not go against the spirit of vedic teachings. That's all.

ISKCON devotee: So is the *ritvik* system, taking mala, name, etc from
living *ritvik*\ s and considering |SP| as the
*diksha-guru*, violating vedic spirit?

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: No no nothing, nothing. That is not
that...

ISKCON devotee: This ritvik-system, where Prabhupada in his absence
where they act, you know these *ritvik*\ s as his representatives, and
giving, conducting this ceremony while still Prabhupada as the
*diksha-guru*, if this process if we continue, is it violating any vedic
*sastra*?

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: You see it can be done like this.
Everybody must take *diksha* before the *vigraha*\ of Prabhupada

ISKCON devotee: Prabhupada murthi's are kept everywhere in ISKCON
temples.

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: You have a temple of Prabhupada, and
before Prabhupada himself, no others can give *diksha* and these people
provide name and *mala*. The *diksha* should be in the presence of
Prabhupada's *vigraha*. That will be better. That would be better. There
will be no problem. Just to avoid problems, see so many gurus, they will
leave peeta (the sacred seat), they are falling down. Just to avoid
this, you take initiation before Prabhupada's *vigraha.*

ISKCON devotee: We are actually not saying that this should be practiced
because of a reaction for the fall down of gurus. Even if the gurus are
not falling down we are saying you should still follow this because it
is the *acharya's ajna.*

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: Yes, I have simply told... This can also
be avoided. No, that is not the only reason because in fact that is my
concept. People ask me who is your guru. I have been taught by so many
swamji's . I have not been initiated into sanyasa. That is different.
People ask me, "You are being an eminent scholar, who is your guru."
Then I used to say, "*Madhvacharya* is my guru. None else." I don't
accept anybody else as my direct guru. *Even now if I have got any
doubt, I put the question before Madhvacharya and he must send the
message, the answer to my mind and I don't ask anybody! So this is a
very powerful practice. Taking initiation from mula guru. See these
people are instruments, to provide this and that, what ever is
required.*

ISKCON devotee: For that we are saying, we will respect them and ...

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: If that vision is created, it will be a
very powerful, very good system. There will be no controversy. All the
problems will be avoided.

ISKCON devotee: Will this stop the *parampara*? They claim that this
will stop the *parampara.*

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: Why? Taking initiation from mula guru and
following the *parampara*. How can it be stopped?

ISKCON devotee: This is one of their objections. You can't take from a
departed *acharya* because it will stop the *parampara*. So who will
continue the *parampara*? That is what they are asking.

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: See Guru *parampara* means, now here is
*Madhvacharya*, (pointing to the disciplic succession listed in Bhagavad
Gita As It Is) and then this swami, and his swami, like that 31 swamis
are there. So this *parampara* will be there. Everybody is disciple of
guru, Prabhupada. *Prabhupada and his disciple, his disciple, his
disciple ― this parampara will not be there. That is alright.*

ISKCON devotee: That is what Pejavar Swami said, "Peeta *parampara* (the
succession of the sacred seat of the institutional head) will not be
there. But upadesha *parampara* will continue..."

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: There is no problem in that. It is there
in practice in *Madhva mathas* because the guru initiates the disciple.
When that tradition is not there, Prabhupada himself is the initiating
or\ *diksha-guru*, then his matha *parampara* will not be there.

ISKCON devotee: But will that not stop the *parampara*?

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: No, no how. No question of stopping.
*parampara* does not stop. All this in an institution, all seniority,
junior swamis, who is to become President, something, this and that. All
those problems will arise. Managerial problems and institutional
problems may be there but in spiritual practice there is no problem.
Here there are two aspects. One is external - institutional, managerial
problems. When you build an institution, there should be some
constitution, some managerial....

ISKCON devotee: That Prabhupada has said GBC is the ultimate managing
authority...

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: And this should not be mixed up with the
spiritual practices. It is different.

ISKCON devotee: Now they show the principle, they quote, many places
where Prabhupada expressed himself, "I want each of my disciples to
become gurus."

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: Anybody can become guru. He can teach
*Vaiṣṇava-siddhanta* to the masses and he can become guru. To become
guru... Giving *diksha* is not the only method of becoming guru. If I
want to become guru, I must teach my disciples and I am guru. My
students are there. They give respect to me. They say he is my guru. He
taught me this *omkar*. That is all. Without knowing ... Guruhood should
come through his knowledge and his practice.....I mean tapasya. It
cannot be demanded.

ISKCON devotee: In other words *siksha*. You can always be *siksha*
guru.

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: I can teach others. But *diksha*
guru....well, unless I have that power I cannot give *diksha* to others.
So again how can I claim that I have that power. "You don't have that
power. I will give you that power..." It is all again a controversy.
There is no end to this controversy.

ISKCON devotee: According to *Madhva siddhanta*, can a *Maha-bhagavatha*
fall down? *Uttam adhikari, mahabhagavatha?*

**Sri Bannanje Govind**\ **acarya**\ **:** The question is irrelevant.
Because if he is a *Maha-bhagavatha*, he cannot fall. If he falls down
he is not a *Maha-bhagavatha*. What is the definition of
*Maha-bhagavatha*? First we have to know that. According to the
Bhagavata purana, a person who has practiced the Vaiṣṇava system
according to Maha Śrīmad Bhāgavata and has reached certain level. Then
if he is *Maha-bhagavatha*, he cannot come down. He cannot fall down.
Sometimes it happens, even realised souls have *prarabhdha karma*. That
is also told. Even the realised souls who have seen Narayana face to
face, eye to eye, *Vishnu-sakshat-kara* is there, after realisation also
due to *prarabdha* *karma* also some people may fall down. That is there
in the scriptures. Generally *Maha-bhagavatha*\ cannot fall down - Its
very rare - some earth breaking instances - You leave it, it's only for
argument sake.

ISKCON devotee: Do you agree that one can become guru only on the order
of his guru? Or can he just become guru? How can he become guru? -
giving *diksha*. Prabhupada says that it is a rule that he has to get an
order to continue the *parampara*. What do you say?

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: Through guru *parampara* giving
initiation is in practice in so many systems. In *Madhva system* it is
there, in *Shankara* and *Ramanuja*\ system. In all the systems now the
person who is authorised to give initiation comes in the *peeta* (sacred
seat of the institutional head). Whoever comes in the peeta is
authorised to give. That tradition is there now. And in fact, this is
just a managerial system, administrative system. Just to solve the
administrative problem, they have adopted this method. *Strictly
speaking, in the spiritual field anybody can initiate who is siddha
purusha and even if not entitled by guru. Traditionally this is not
accepted. If I am a mantra siddha, I need not have a sanction from my
guru or any tradition. I can initiate anybody.* This is sastric. But
there are two things - institutional systems is that only the
peeta-adhipati (the person presiding over the peeta) guru can initiate.
That is the system in the *Madhva mutts*. In fact only *siddha purusa*
can initiate and he need not be a *siddha purusa* who has come in the
traditional way in the peeta.

ISKCON devotee: But he has to be authorised.

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: He is authorised.

ISKCON devotee: If he is a *siddha purusa*, automatically the
authorisation will be there for him.

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya*: Yes, yes. That's what I am saying. If he
is not *siddha purusa*, though he is there in the peeta, lineage,
according to *sastra* he is not authorised. But the present system
accepts that he is guru! But according to the *sastra*, he need not come
in the *peeta*. *If he is a siddha purusa and he is realised, he can
give diksha to anyone.* There is no sanction of tradition that is
necessary to accept him as guru. *The only requirement for diksha is I
must be a realised person, siddha purusa of that mantra which I am
giving you. If it is Vishnu mantra, I must be siddha in that Vishnu
mantra or Narayana mantra or whatever it is*.

This is not only giving *mantra* upadesa but this is accepting somebody
into the fold of a certain system. Then some system must be there. Its
again institutionalisation. Some system. Then whatever the tradition
says that is to be accepted to accept him into this fold. So all the
other *sampradayas* accept that there is a *guru-parampara* in the
peetas and they are entitled to give *diksha*. According to *sastra*
anybody can give mudra dharana. I can give mudra to my children. But
according to the present practice in the mutts, *sampradaya* system,
they do not accept it. They say, "Only we have the authority. Only we
have the authority. We can give mudra dharana. But nobody else..." Some
of our swamis say, "These people belong to Uttaradi mutt, they belong to
Pejawar mutt.." and so on. Again there is division. "And you cannot take
*Vaiṣṇava* *diksha* from some other swami. I am your mula vidya guru.
You take *diksha* from me." No it has become a social right.
Spirituality has nothing to do with this. This is again the present
plight of the muttas. There are two things. One is the social aspect of
traditional acceptance, another is spiritual practice.

ISKCON devotee: That's interesting. So we understand that the spiritual
component of *diksha* Prabhupada retains for himself.

Sri Bannanje Govindacarya: Yes that is what I am saying. It is safe. If
we accept the spiritual *diksha* is Prabhupada, if we accept that then
so many problems will be solved.

ISKCON devotee: According to our Governing Body themselves, they agree
that they cannot deliver the souls back to Krishna. It is Prabhupada
only that much they agree. The only thing is they don't want to give
Prabhupada the post of *diksha-guru*. Of course now the siddhanta is
diluted so much because of the lack of qualified *diksha* gurus that
they are saying that even a *kanistha-adhikari* or *madhyama-adhikari*
can become guru. But Prabhupada cannot become *diksha-guru*. His only
disqualification is that he is not present with us.

Sri Bannanje Govindacarya: In other sampradayas they say that only
living guru can give *diksha*. Therefore they are also claiming the same
thing. In other sampradayas the *diksha-guru* must be a living guru. He
cannot give *diksha* with his spiritual body, non material body. He must
give with his gross material body only - that tradition is there. This
is not siddhanta or apasiddhanta. Tradition is a social system. It is
nothing to do with the spiritual. Society accepted this just to have a
control on disciples from the *peeta* or *matha*. Swami should have
certain control of the disciples. So they have accepted certain rights -
they are his copyrights! So that he can have certain control over the
society. This is a social system presently accepted by the spiritual
priests. *Philosophy and practice have nothing to do with it.*

ISKCON devotee: I cannot claim to become regular guru - for that I have
to provide evidence. These are the only two questions we are asking
them.

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya:* Spiritually you are correct. For the
organizational system if there is any thing to be done, that is left to
you. I don't know. If there is any social problem it has to be set
right.

ISKCON devotee: In short, is the *ritvik-system* against any vedic
system?

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya:* It is neither vedic nor non vedic. Just
to have an international contact, *Prabhupada himself created this
system and he is the final authority. It is not against the preaching of
the vedas.*

ISKCON devotee: So Prabhupada can remain a *diksha-guru* and these
people can conduct just like the *ritvik*\ s?

Sri Bannanje Govind\ *acarya:* That can be done. There is no problem in
this system. Because it is an international institution it is natural
that all the people may not be scholars in sastras or sanskrit. But they
will be managerial heads. *That is why it is inevitable to accept
Prabhupada as diksha-guru. It is essential thing to accept him as
diksha-guru and these are the instruments*.

When we (devotees at `ISKCON
Bangalore <http://www.iskconirm.com/28.htm>`__) came to know that HG
Basugosh Prabhu, was arranging a conference of Madhvas & Sri Vaiṣṇava
Scholars to discuss the guru issue, we vehemently opposed. As we found
no authorization from |SP| for such an exercise.

We see HG Basugosh Prabhus' postings are misleading devotees around the
world by his one sided presentation.

However, since the exercise has begun we find it only appropriate to
present the response of these scholars what they actually say on this
issue after objectively presenting the guru issue to them.

HG Vidvan Gauranga Das had written in one of the postings on Chakra
about these scholars:

**'Vidyavachaspati' Bannanje Govindachar**: Disciple of Vidyamanya
Tirtha Swami, Mathadhisa of Palimara Matha. He is a very prominent
lecturer and scholar, recognized by the 8 mathas.

Bannanje Govindachar, the Maadhva devotee-scholar was awarded the title
'Vidyaa-vaachaspati' by one of the 8 Madhva-mathas. (read the interview
posted with Govindachar, above)

**Sri Sri Rangapriya Swami Desikachar**: A broad-minded Sri Vaiṣṇava
scholar and sannyasi. He was previously a professor in National College,
Bangalore. He is a Sanskrit scholar. He has disciples who come from
Smaarta, Sri Vaiṣṇava and Maadhva backgrounds. (for the information of
the readers, these two above mentioned scholars were not invited to the
conference by HG Basugosh Prabhu!)

The following is a short interview with Rangapriya Swami:

**Question:** According to |SP|'s letter of July 9th, 1977,
if we accept |SP| as the diksa guru and receive initiation
from the *ritviks*, is this system in accordance to sastric principles,
what is your holiness' opinion?

HH Rangapriya Swami: It appears from the system of initiation that |SP|
has proposed in his letter of July 9th 1977, that he wished
to remain the *diksha-acharya*, vanquish sinful reactions of the
disciples, take the responsibility of delivering his disciples and this
way continue the parampara through the *rtviks*. This is a new system.
Since such new systems have been created in the past by the *acaryas*,
it appears that |SP| desired such a system. This is our
humble opinion and it is not in violation of any shastric principles.

**Question:** Do we have to fear that the parampara will stop if we
follow the *ritvik-system*?

**HH Rangapriya Swami:** By this system we do not have to fear that the
parampara may stop. The *rtviks* belong to his *parampara*. The new
disciples also belong to his *parampara*. Who ever follows his
instructions also belong to his *parampara.* His books will represent
him; his peeta (the sacred seat) will represent him; his sandals will
represent him; his murtis will represent him.

**Question:** If we ask the new disciples initiated by this system,
'Whose disciple are you?" what should they say?

**HH Rangapriya Swami:** They should say, '|SP| is my guru.'
Others can be called ritviks and can be respected for their seniority.

**Question:** As long as ISKCON exists, can this system be followed?

**HH Rangapriya Swami:** Yes, there is no problem.

Copy of the letter given to ISKCON: (11.1.99).

I have acquainted myself with the life and message of His Holiness |SP|
including his message in the letter of July 9th, 1977. I also
understand there is some controversy going on among the disciples of the
great guru regarding the positions of the *diksha-guru* and officiating
*acharyas* called *rtvik* *acharyas* who give *diksha* as deputees of
the original acharya, even as Prince Bharata officiated as the ruler on
behalf of Sri Rama's padukas.

In this connection, keeping in view the spirit of |SP| and
the continuation of the great tradition given by him, we recommend that
the office of the *rtvik acharyas* should continue as intended by |SP|.

|SP|'s system accords a unique position to the *acarya* by
declaring that he should be a Master Yogin, who takes upon himself the
spiritual responsibility of the disciples including the destruction of
all their sins and deserves worship due to Bhagavan Himself.

*The rtvik-acharya continue the line of HH |SP|, and he
should be accorded reverence in accordance with his contributions*.
**But he should not be considered as an object of meditation and
worship**. Nor should he be considered as infallible. He should be
appointed by the governing council and give *diksha* as a deputee of
|SP| without violating the letter and spirit of his message.

The *ritvik-system* propounded by |SP| does not violate in
anyway the *shastras*' injunctions.

Signed: Rangapriya Swami.

Choice passages from the interview with professor M.A. Tatachar
============================================================================

Can an acharya who is not physically present giveDIKSA?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ISKCON devotee:** Our point is that although |SP| is not
physically present, that does not in any way stop the validity of his
continuing to be *diksha-guru.*

**Sri Tatachar:** Definitely. That is my view.

**ISKCON devotee:** Can the absence of a physical body limit the
functioning of the *acharya*, in terms of |SP| being able to
impart knowledge and take *karma* of the disciples? Can |SP|
do this now?

**Sri Tatachar:** Just because somebody has a physical body, can he take
your karma? Is he competent to do it? The presence or the absence of the
physical body is not the criteria to take away the *karma* of a
particular person. On the other hand, it depends on the devotion of the
disciple and the grace of the *acharya*. Say for instance, |SP|'s
guru was not there when |SP| was present. Do
you mean to say that they are not capable of taking the karma of their
disciple? The interesting thing is (quotes a verse in Sanskrit from
*Yatindra vimsati* composed by Sri Manavala Mamuni of Sri Vaiṣṇava *sampradaya*,
who appeared nearly 200 years after Sri Ramanuja).

**ISKCON devotee:** So what is the import of this statement?

**Sri Tatachar:** That means though the guru is not physically present,
he can take away all the karmas of the disciple. That is the potency of
the *acharya*. In that way, it is not important whether the *acharya* is
alive with a physical body or not. That is not important.

**ISKCON devotee:** One of their objections is that it stops the
*parampara*.

**Sri Tatachar:** How does it stop the *parampara*? These *ritvik*\ s
will further appoint *ritvik*\ s.

**ISKCON devotee:** There is a provision for that. Prabhupada says more
can be added when necessary.

**Sri Tatachar:** More can be added and these *ritvik*\ s will initiate
all of them into the Hare Krishna movement and |SP| will be
their guru. What harm is there? Because the very word '*ritvik*' has a
special significance here. What do you mean by *ritvik*? A person who
performs this particular duty. Suppose a king performs a sacrifice he is
considered a *yajaman*. Even now wealthy people organise for us,
Sudarshana homa. Probably in your place also. So that person is called a
*yajamana*. When we came to your place Madhu Pandit Das was the
*yajamana*. He didn't perform the sacrifice. He engaged all these people
- Venkatesh and I came and many other people came and we performed the
homa. After performing the homa we were given *dakshina.* So our
relationship ends there itself. Because we had received the *dakshina*
for the service we had rendered. But the end result goes to whom? To the
*yajamana* only. Similarly, these *ritvik*\ s get some *dakshina* from
the persons whom they initiate. Once that is done their work is over.
But the result that such and such a person is a disciple of such and
such a guru goes to |SP|. That's why the word **ritvik** is
used here. Otherwise he would have used a different word. And he would
have stated that these are my *sishyas*, these *sishyas* are here
afterwards considered to be the gurus to succeed me. "He is my
successor," he didn't say that.

Does the *rtvik-system* violate any Vedic principles of guru *parampara?*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ISKCON devotee:** You have compared the arrangement in the Sri
*sampradaya* with that of the *ritvik* arrangement that |SP|
has directed us to follow. (He also supervised the running of this
system from July to November, 1977). In *ritvik-system*, there is an
important difference. Here |SP| is not giving any guruship
to the *ritviks*...

**Sri Tatachar:** Yes, that is right, that is what we see from the
letter also.

**ISKCON devotee:** In the event of the *ritviks*\ being representatives
only and not being gurus, is there a violation of any shastric principle
or is it violating any spiritual...

**Sri Tatachar:** No, it is not violating. On the other hand, it
supports what I have stated. In the case of Sri Ramanuja, I have stated
that he appointed 74 *simhasana-adhipatis* and made them gurus. In spite
of that we owe our allegiance to Sri Ramanuja only.

**ISKCON devotee:** You are saying that in spite of being some sort of
guru, you are the disciple of Sri Ramanuja only?

**Sri Tatachar:** Yes, definitely. That is why we say that we are Sri
Ramanuja dasan only. I have to say, adiyen madhura kavi Lakshmi
Tatacharya Ramanuja dasan, when I prostrate before anyone. Sri Ramanuja
dasa is the common thing found in all the Sri Vaiṣṇavas, though we have
been initiated by one of the *simhasana-adhipatis* appointed by Sri
Ramanuja himself who were considered to be gurus. In spite of this we
are expected to state that we are disciples of Sri Ramanuja only.

**ISKCON devotee:** In our case it is clear that |SP| did
not give any guruship...

**Sri Tatachar:** So it is all the more clear and imperative because
|SP| mentions very clearly in the letter that these are
*ritviks*. That is why I have given the meaning of the *ritviks* - this
word comes from the rig veda. The *ritvik* is a sacrificer who is
appointed by the *yajamana*. Suppose you are the *yajamana*, you can
appoint me as the *ritvik* and this *ritvik* performs the role of a
priest on behalf of the *yajamana*. This may happen when the *yajamana*
does not know the vedic rituals or even if he knows and if he is not in
a position to perform this role, then he may appoint a *ritvik*.

So he will perform the sacrifice and give *dakshina* to the
*ritviks*...Who gets the result of the sacrifice? It obviously goes to
the person who has engaged these rtviks and sent money for the
sacrifice, the *yajamana.*

The word *ritvik* is very significant. That is why |SP| was
so clever to say that *they are only*\ **ritviks**\ *and not acaryas*.
So the result goes to |SP| *only.*

Again, will the parampara stop?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ISKCON devotee:** In the Bhagavad Gita, |SP| gives the
*guru-parampara* - Brahma, Narada, Vyāsa...and so on till |SP|.
In the *ritvik-system*, who comes after |SP|?

**Sri Tatachar:** |SP| himself. Only the *ritvik-system*
continues and |SP| is the guru.

**ISKCON devotee:** When that happens, is the *parampara* not stopping?

**Sri Tatachar:** No. What can be done? |SP| has not
appointed an *acharya*. The *parampara* continues through a chain of
*ritviks*.

Is authorization essential to become an acharya?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ISKCON devotee:** One final question is that for somebody has to
become an *acharya*, how important is it for him to receive an
authorisation to take that post from the previous *acharya*? In this
case, there is an authorisation to continue to as a *ritvik* and
*ritvik* alone, there is not authoriation to function as guru. How
important is it to receive an authorisation?

**Sri Tatachar:** It is very much necessary to receive an authorisation.
Without an authorisation you cannot do. Generally what happens in the
*Sri Vaiṣṇava* *parampara*, they were always worried about the
succession (*Tamil* *sloka*). Who will be the successor to take care of
the propagation of this system? When the *acharya* was about to pass
away, he would nominate a person to take care of the *panth* and hold
the mantle thereafter. That is how it has been done. That is why even in
the *Sri Vaiṣṇava parampara*, while giving sannyasa, he cannot take
sannyasa on his own. The *acharya* will give the sanyas and say that
here afterwards he will be the *mathadipathi*.

**ISKCON devotee:** That means authorization is a must.

**Sri Tatachar:** IT IS A MUST

**ISKCON devotee:** To become a guru or a *mathadipathi* or a
*peethadipathi*

**Sri Tatachar:** Yes, yes, yes. Otherwise I am very sure that SP would
have used another word altogether instead of '*ritvik*\ s'. “These are
my successors” - no problem. He never said “successors”. *Again and
again he stresses*\ **'these are my representatives only'**\ *, 'they
are only expected to initiate them, ultimately all of them are my
disciples only, not the disciples of others'.*

Third Chapter
****************************


**Hidden avatar of the Lord**
============================================================================

This is the very elevated and mysterious subject. Here we shall come to
know the innermost about |HDGSP|. Before
starting with this subject we prayed to f Śrīmatī Radharani and Lord
Krishna asking for Their Grace and consent to be able to glorify, in the
best way, our dear and beloved Gurudeva |HDGSP|,
the greatest among the greatest in all material and
spiritual worlds.

There are many books written about |HDGSP| but
unfortunately none of them reflect what He really was. None of the books
revealed the full merit of |SP| and whole truth about Him.
Authors of these books, to say the least, understated or hided something
and occasionally even invented and told lies. In none of the book, the
love of the disciple to his spiritual master |SP|, is felt.
Even with all their academic educations nobody was able to reveal the
beauty of His Divine Greatness.

All these authors did not want and were not able to tell about |SP|
everything He deserves and what He is worth of. Some of them
had a great luck to have close relations with |SP| - the
greatest\ **sadhu** and render Him direct service. However due to their
conditioned nature they were not able to recognize His Divine nature.
The reason is that, unfortunately, none of these authors is a completely
and sincerely surrendered soul, besides they have gone against His will,
rejecting the last order of Prabhupada. And those who go against the
will of one’s spiritual master, the acharya - representative of Supreme
Personality of Godhead are considered an offenders. Therefore |SP|
is hidden from them by His Divine energy. He opens only to
those who are fully and *sincerely* dedicated to Him.

In September 1965 at the age of 69 years |HDGSP|, without even having sufficient money for his living, arrived
to NEW YORK city on the cargo ship to fulfill the Mission entrusted on
Him. Having spent less than a year in USA facing many obstacles |SP|
founder, developed and registered, on July 13 1966, the
International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) which has no
analogues and will never have for thousands of **kali-yugas** or
8.640.000.000 terrestrial years. Before |SP| left this world
on November 14 1977 ISKCON Society has grown into Worldwide confederacy
consisting of more than one hundred *ashrams*, schools, temples,
institutes and agricultural communes.

Already before His departure to America, living in a very plain way in
the historical medieval temple Radha-Damodar, |SP| began to
work on His masterpiece - a multivolume translation and commentary to
"Śrīmad Bhāgavatam" ("Bhagavata-purana"), the classical philosophical
scripture on Sanskrit, which consists of eighteen thousand verses.
Having published first three volumes of "Śrīmad Bhāgavatam" |SP|
went to America and within few years released more than sixty
volumes of translation, commentaries and overview essays of the Indian
classical works on philosophy and religion. His works are currently
translated to more than seventy five languages of the world.
"Bhaktivedanta Book Trust" (the publishing founded by Him in 1972) is
the biggest publisher of the works on Indian philosophy and religion in
the world. Even though |SP| was always totally occupied He
never stopped writing His books. Works of |SP| form
unexcelled, authentic encyclopedia of Vedic philosophy, religion and
culture.

In the West Virginia |SP| has founded a spiritual commune
"New Vrindavana" and incorporated in the west the Vedic system of
education founding the *Gurukul* in Dallas. Majestic Krishna-Balaram
temple and the hotel for pilgrims from the whole world were built in
Vrindavan. Temples were also built in Mayapure, Bombay and many other
great cities of India. Regardless His old age |SP| has gone
round the world fourteen times within twelve years, lecturing on all
five continents, where He has established hundred eight splendid Krishna
temples and cultural centers of ISKCON.

The greatness of |HDGSP| is infinite, like a
boundless ocean. Even thousands of Ananta-Sesha’s tongues are not enough
to glorify Him fully. All that was created by |SP| is a
treasure, invaluable gift for the whole mankind and the most important
and amazing among all the things He has created, are His Divine books,
shining like a sun in this pitch-darkness of *Kali-yuga* ignorance.

*|SP| says*: "My books will be the law books for the next
ten thousand years"

(|SP| statement in Los Angeles, 1976)

And what is more amazing is that |SP| has *installed a
unique system of*\ **transferring**\ *the transcendental knowledge
(*\ **initiation**\ *)* - by means of His books which He has enriched
with *Krishna-prema* -love to God. Anyone who sincerely, with faith and
devotion takes into hands these books with the hope to find the
transcendental knowledge gets the seed of the creeper of devotional
service to the Lord.

Holy scriptures say:

   *jive sakshat nahi tate guru caitya-rupe*

   *siksa-guru haya krsna mahanta svarupe*

**“Since one cannot visually experience the presence of the Supersoul,
He appears before us as a liberated devotee. Such a spiritual master is
none other than Krishna Himself.”**

We all know that |SP| is a representative of Krishna,
thereby He is an external manifestation to Supreme Personality of
Godhead, however there exists another statement, which we shall know
little further.

*|SP| says*: "You can learn about God by always keeping
yourself under his protection, or under the protection of **His
representative**. Then, without a doubt, you can perfectly understand
God. *Otherwise there is no question of understanding Him*. Therefore to
receive the transcendental knowledge we must *completely surrender to
the*\ **bona fide**\ *\ *\ **acharya**, striving to inquire him and
serve him. The true service to Absolute *under the guidance of acharya*
― is the only mean to perceive the transcendental knowledge".

(Dialectical spiritualism)

We would like to turn the reader’s attention to this verse, from here it
becomes evident what kind of personality is worth of being a
*diksha-guru*.

When Lord Krishna came to this earth He remained unsatisfied since in
that time nobody could surrender to Him. We are all inseparable
spiritual parts of the Lord. Lord Krishna loves all of us as His
children and feels enormous compassion towards us because we are
suffering in this material world. Lord always shows care for us and
thinks how to help us come back to Him. And therefore once Krishna made
a plan how to bless the most fallen souls with chanting His holy name in
this *Kali-yuga*. When He shared this plan with His beloved Śrīmatī
Radharani She asked Krishna: “but what about me?” – “You will come with
Me!” - the Lord said. “But what about My dear girlfriends: Lalita,
Vishakha and all My dear gopies, as well as My beloved woods of
Vrindavana, river Yamuna, Govardhan hill and so dear to My heart
Radha-kunda and Siyama-kunda lakes?” – “You can take them also with
You.” And then Śrīmatī Radharani carried the holy Vrindavan over to
Navadvipa in the heart of Bengalia.

Caytanya Mahaprabhu was born in Mayapure, Nadia city right after the
sunset in the evening of 18 February in the year 1486 of our Redemption.
And since the times of Lord Caytania Mahaprabhu Mayapur was considered
to be not different from holy dhama Vrindavana. Lord Caytanya - is
Krishna Himself. Every time the Supreme Lord Krishna comes into this
world, He appears in Mathura and Vrindavan, for He is closely connected
to them. In other words, though Mathura and Vrindavan are located on the
earth, they represent the transcendental abode of the Lord. Thereby
Mayapur dhama also represents the transcendental abode of Lord Krishna.
Anyone, who is involved into devotional service in these places and
lives his body surely returns back home, to God.

Radhika also confessed to Krishna that She has her own special plan as
well, which we shall discuss little later. But now we shell learn what
|SP| tells about Krishna’s plan:

“Krishna came as He is, but people misunderstood Him because He appeared
to them as an ordinary human being. Because they could not surrender
unto Him, He came later as a devotee, Caitanya Mahaprabhu to teach man
how to approach God. That is a consept of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya understood His activities and wrote about a
hundres verses in appreciation.

Two of these verses read:

"Let me take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
`Śrī <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/s/sri>`__
`Kṛṣṇa <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/k/krsna>`__, who has descended in
the form of Lord `Caitanya <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/c/caitanya>`__
`Mahāprabhu <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/m/mahaprabhu>`__ to teach us
real knowledge, His devotional service and detachment from whatever does
not foster `Kṛṣṇa <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/k/krsna>`__
consciousness. He has descended because He is an ocean of transcendental
mercy. Let me surrender unto His lotus feet. Let my consciousness, which
is like a honeybee, take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who has just now appeared as
`Śrī <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/s/sri>`__
`Kṛṣṇa <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/k/krsna>`__
`Caitanya <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/c/caitanya>`__
`Mahāprabhu <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/m/mahaprabhu>`__ to teach the
ancient system of devotional service to Himself. This system had almost
been lost due to the influence of time."

(C. C., Madhya 6.254-255)

“Thus Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya understood that Caitanya Mahaprabhu – is
the very same Krishna and He came to teach the *bhakti-yoga* and process
of the renunciation. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu taught the same philosophy
of Bhagavad-gītā. However He didn’t come as Krishna, but as a devotee of
Krishna. Rupa Gosvami also appreciated Caitanya Mahaprabhu as the most
munificent incarnation because He does not only give Krishna, but also
pure love to Krishna. *Namo maha vadanyaya-krisna-prema-pradaya te*. In
order to give Himself to the devotee, Krishna demands full surrender,
but Caitanya Mahaprabhu grants pure love to Krishna without any demands.
Because we are all His sons, Krishna, the Supreme Lord, is affectionate
towards us. Because we are rotting in this material world, Krishna comes
Himself, or as a devotee, and leaves His instructions. He is always
anxious to enlighten a human being and show him how to return home, back
to Godhead.”

(Dialectical Spiritualism)

Therefore Caytaniya Mahaprabhu is called the most generous incarnation
for He has presented Krishna-prema to the world. *Namo maha
vadanjaja-krisna-prema-pradaja te
krisnaja-krisna-caitnja-namne-gaura-tvishe namah.*

It’s not incidental that Hare Krishna *mantra* is called the
*Maha-mantra*, the greatest, the highest amongst all other Vedic
mantras. Simple chanting of Hare Krishna *mantra* renders the strongest
beneficial influence.

Sri Caytanya Mahaprabhu has said about this very well (Sikshashtaka 1):

   *cheto-darpana-marjanam bhava-maha-davagni-nirvapanam*

   *shreyah-kairava-chandrika-vitaranam vidya-vadhu-jivanam*

   *anandambhdhi-vardhanam prati-padam purnamritasvadanam*

   *sarvatma-snapanam param vijayate shri-krishna-sankirtanam*

“Glory to the Shri Krishna saṅkīrtana (congregational chanting of the
Lord's holy names), which cleanses the heart of all the dust accumulated
for years and extinguishes the fire of conditional life, of repeated
birth and death. That saṅkīrtana movement is the prime benediction for
humanity at large because it spreads the rays of the benediction moon.
It is the life of all transcendental knowledge. It increases the ocean
of transcendental bliss, and it enables us to fully taste the nectar for
which we are always anxious.”

*Prabhupada says*: "But
`Caitanya <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/c/caitanya>`__
`Mahaprabhu <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/m/mahaprabhu>`__ gives a
practical demonstration of how to love God in a conjugal relationship.
Taking the part of `Śrīmatī <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/s/srimati>`__
Radharani, `Caitanya <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/c/caitanya>`__
`Mahaprabhu <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/m/mahaprabhu>`__ tried to
love `Krishna <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/k/krsna>`__ as Radharani
loved Him. `Krishna <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/k/krsna>`__ was
always amazed by Radharani's love. "How does Radharani give Me such
pleasure?" He would ask. In order to study Radharani,
`Krishna <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/k/krsna>`__ lived in Her role
and tried to understand Himself. This is the secret of Lord
`Caitanya <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/c/caitanya>`__'s incarnation.
`Caitanya <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/c/caitanya>`__ Mahaparbhu is
`Krishna <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/k/krsna>`__, but He has taken
the mood and role of Radharani to show us how to love
`Krishna <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/k/krsna>`__. " (Sri Caitanya
Caritamrita introduction).

Krishna is perfect in Oneself. And so Krishna wonders: "Why am I so
attracted to Radharani? And what actually Radharani feels, when She
feels My love?" To feel the taste of these amorous relations, Krishna
appeared as Lord Caytanya Mahaprabhu.

So, we come back to the point where Śrīmatī Radharani confessed to
Krishna that She has a plan. Radhika said: "I also want to spread the
glory of Your holy name and gift the most fallen soles of this
*Kali*\ age with *Krishna-prema*. I shall come right after You, in the
form of a pure devotee and spread the glory of Your holy name round the
whole universe, Your holy name will be chanted in each city and each
village."

*Prabhupada says*: "Radha and Krishna present the integral whole, but
They also separate. Without Radha Krishna has no sense, but without
Krishna there is no sense in Radha".

Radhika – is a boundless ocean of love to Lord Krishna. She loves Him so
powerfully that She wants everyone in this material world to know
Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and all of us to be His
eternal servants. We are here from times immemorial and we have
completely forgotten about the God. Radhika wants to tell everyone how
amazing Krishna is – the all-merciful and all-good, most pleasing and
most attractive, most pure and most beautiful. Krishna is indescribably
beautiful.

Krishna’s beauty extinguishes the beauty of millions of cupids (gods of
love). Only loving devotees with the eyes paved with the balm of love to
God can see this beautiful image of Supreme Lord.

Radhika ― the boundless ocean of the humility and compassions. She
infinitely loves Krishna and all his integral parts. Out of Her love to
Him She considers all conditioned souls as pure devotees of Lord and
feels enormous compassion to them, well understanding that at the
present state they are in painful condition. Radhika passionately wants
to cure each of us from our disease of material existence and awaken our
love to Lord Krishna and return home, back to God.

Sastras say, that **bona fide** guru – is an external manifestation to
Supreme Personality of Godhead (Krishna). However |SP| – is
a special avatar of the Lord. *|HDGSP| is -*
**an external manifestation of Śrīmatī Radharani.**

This statement is based on some facts which we shell discuss now.

When Krishna appeared as Lord Caytanya, Radhika appeared together with
Him and Her beloved girlfriends. Caytaniya Mahaprabha is also called
Gauranga, since the color of His body was light-golden. Caytaniya
Mahaprabu says:

`gaura <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/g/gaura>`__\ `ańga <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/a/anga>`__\ `nahe <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/n/nahe>`__\ `mora <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/m/mora>`__\ *—
rādhāńga-*\ `sparśana <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/s/sparsana>`__

`gopendra <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/g/gopendra>`__\ *-*\ `suta <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/s/suta>`__\ `vinā <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/v/vina>`__\ `teńho <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/t/tenho>`__\ `nā <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/n/na>`__\ `sparśe <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/s/sparse>`__\ `anya <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/a/anya>`__\ *-*\ `jana <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/j/jana>`__

"Actually My body does not have a fair complexion. It only appears so
because it has touched the body of
`Śrīmatī <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/s/srimati>`__ Rādhārāṇī.
However, She does not touch anyone but the son of
`Nanda <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/n/nanda>`__
`Mahārāja <http://caitanyacaritamrta.com/m/maharaja>`__."

(C.C., Madhya, 8. 287)

Caytaniya Mahaprabhu says: "This is not Gaura’s body. This is the body
of Radha". Consequently, *Radha-bhava* dominates in Gaura. Since the
appearance of Gaura this *guru-parampara* becomes - Gaura-parampara and
this means: Radha-parampara. Such is our *guru-tattwa*. Gaurasundara
dwells in Radha-bhava, this signifies that all the Gauranga followers
are radhanugas. In other words, Gauranga’s followers ― a Radharani’s
followers.

Thereby spiritual masters in our *bona fide* chain of disciplic
succession descending from six Goswamis and up to Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati Thakur are - *radha-priya-sakhi*, dear maids, nearest
companions of Radharani. They were all preparing "ground" for the plays
of Śrīmatī Radharani - |SP|. Each of them was capable of
liberating all three worlds, but they acted in accordance with to plan
of Lord Krishna. Even when Caytanya Mahaprabhu was on the planet
Himself, He only initiated this great Movement of Saṅkīrtana, but main
role in these Lila Lord has given to His sweetheart Śrīmatī Radharani ―
|SP|.

Lilas of Lord Krishna and His eternal beloved Śrīmatī Radharani are
amazingly beautiful, inexhaustible and endless, they are innumerable
just like waves in the ocean, they are instinct with boundless bliss,
happiness and greatest pure love! As a matter of fact Radha-Krishna ― is
an exchange of love. It’s not a common love. Radha and Krishna manifest
Their plays by means of the internal energy of Krishna. When Krishna
wants to enjoy His potency of enjoyment, He manifests Himself in
separate form of Radharani, but when He wants to understand Himself by
means of Radha, He unites with Radharani, and this union is called Lord
Caytanya.

Lord Caytanya Mahaprabhu kindly manifested His spiritual Lila for the
good of all mankind. He didn’t just bring *Krishna-prama* – love to God
into this world, but also a touch of *satya-yuga* for 10.000 years
within this *kali-yuga*. Lilas of Lord Krishna are held in strict
correspondence with the holy scripturs. But sometimes, to give pleasure
to His pure devotees, Lord adds to His Lilas special celestial color,
thus baffling the self-conceited fools, who think themselves to be
experts in Sastras. When the plays of Lord Caytanya were coming to an
end His close companions asked Him: What will happen after your
departure? Who will continue your play, Your Mission of Saṅkīrtana?
Gauranga answered: **"My General will come and continue My Mission".**
Pure devotees and close companions of Lord Caytanya immediately guessed
whom He meant and started exclaiming in enthusiasm "Haribol! Haribol!"
They were happy to hear from Lord Caytanya about such an amazing play of
Radha and Krishna. Who can speak in this way? **"My General will
come!"** Only the spouse can speak so of his wife. **"My General!"**
This means that Krishna-Caytanya spoke of Śrīmatī Radharani. And here
came the time, and appeared the "General" of Lord Gauranga – this is
|SP|.

Actually |SP| is a continuation of the Lord Gauranga’s play
and is not different from Him. When Prabhupada has revealed His Lila and
continued the play of Lord Caytanya, He said in the same manner as Lord
did: **"Only Lord Chaytanya can occupy my place. He will take care of
this movement".**

(|SP| conversation 2.11 .1977)

Lord Caytanya ― is Krishna Himself. Who can speak of Krishna in this way
except Śrīmatī Radharani? "Only Krishna can take My place!" *Only
Radharani can declare so, and no one else.*

This statement can also be considered as a warning for self-appointed
gurus and protects |SP| from all sorts of encroachment on
His place.

Once disciples complained to |SP| that people do not buy the
Deities of Gaura-Nitay, telling them that this is an idolization. |SP|
smiled and said: "Just tell them: buy these *dolls* and they
will bring you good luck". Who can afford such a transcendental
"familiarity", except Śrīmatī Radharani.

**It’s self-evident that |SP| is an incarnation of Śrīmatī Radharani.**

When disciples asked Him: "|SP|, who are you?" - He
answered: "If I tell you, you won’t believe it". Of course, they
wouldn’t believe and so He said nothing. Even when Krishna Himself was
here on the earth not all but just a few could understand that He was
Supreme Personality of Godhead. And when |SP| was asked at
the press-conferences:

**Journalist:** "Do you prepare the successor?"

**|SP|**: "Yes, this is *my guru Maharaja*".

(|SP| press-conference, 16.07. 75 San Francisco)

What does it mean? It means that His guru Maharaja Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati Thakur is the beloved maid of Śrīmatī Radharani, as it was
already said above and He will replace |SP| - Radharani,
after 10.000 years, when His –Her play is finished. |SP| is
presently on one of the planets of this universe, where He continues to
spread the Krishna consciousness.

"You have asked if it is true that the spiritual master remains in the
universe until all his disciples are transferred to the spiritual sky.
**The answer is yes, this is the rule.**"

(S.P. Letter to Jayapataka, 11/7/69)

Indian lady\ **:** **Is that spiritual master still guiding after the
death?**

*Prabhupada*: **yes, yes. Just like Krishna is guiding us, similarly,
spiritual master will guide.**

(|SP|, lecture 23.09.1969)

Lord Krishna loves Śrīmatī Radharani so much that He accepts Her as His
guru.

Krishna says:

`rādhikāra <http://vedabase.net/r/radhikara>`__\ `prema <http://vedabase.net/p/prema>`__\ *—*\ `guru <http://vedabase.net/g/guru>`__\ *,*\ `āmi <http://vedabase.net/a/ami>`__\ *—*\ `śiṣya <http://vedabase.net/s/sisya>`__\ `naṭa <http://vedabase.net/n/nata>`__

`sadā <http://vedabase.net/s/sada>`__\ `āmā <http://vedabase.net/a/ama>`__\ `nānā <http://vedabase.net/n/nana>`__\ `nṛtye <http://vedabase.net/n/nrtye>`__\ `nācāya <http://vedabase.net/n/nacaya>`__\ `udbhaṭa <http://vedabase.net/u/udbhata>`__

"The love of `Rādhikā <http://vedabase.net/r/radhika>`__ is My teacher,
and I am Her dancing pupil. Her `prema <http://vedabase.net/p/prema>`__
makes Me dance various novel dances" (C.C., Adi, 4. 124).

Krishna completely belongs to Śrīmatī Radharani. Therefore without Her
grace it is impossible to get a service to Krishna. Only Radharani can
give us a chance to serve Krishna. One who accepts Krishna as Highest
guru, should also accept Radharani as a guru. Without the grace of
Śrīmatī Radharani no one can serve Krishna. Radhika as an honest spouse
very carefully and jealously watches over Krishna and nobody is allowed
to disturb Him in vain. She will check our sincere wish to serve Lord
Krishna thousand times before we would be allowed to approach Him. Each
inhabitant of Vrindavana knows this rule well - without the grace of
Radharani it is impossible to approach Krishna.

In (Chandogya Upanishad 8.13.1) is said:

   *syamac chavalam prapadye savalac chyamam pradadye*

"In surrendering to *syama*, Krishna I take shelter of the essence of
the pleasure potency (Radha). In taking shelter of the pleasure potency,
I surrender to Krishna."

Radha and Krishna are not different form each other. Love of Krishna to
Radharani is full of limitless bliss and faultless purity. Radhika, as
if competing with Krishna in love, shows Her highest humility. Dear
readers how do you think, why in all Śrīmad Bhāgavatam except the tenth
Canto Śrīmatī Radharani is never mentioned? Our pseudo gurus from ISKCON
explain in their lecture that Vyāsadeva could not write the name of
Radharani, since whenever He mentioned the name Radha he used to fall
into ecstasy and could not write Śrīmad Bhāgavatam. *This is not true!*
Actually Radhika came Herself personally to Vyāsadeva and asked him not
to mention Her name in Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, but to write only about
Krishna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And anyone else is His
eternal servant. Also she asked that Her appearance in this world in the
form of pure devotee should not be described in Sastras\ **.** It’s a
manifestation of the highest humility and the greatest pure love to Lord
Krishna.

Vyāsadeva agreed to fulfill Her will and asked Radharani to allow him to
write at least one song about Radha and Krishna play. Radhika agreed
with that. Krishna always admires the Radharani’s love. Krishna is
all-attractive, but pure devotional service attracts even Him. This
signifies that pure devotional service being the internal energy of
Krishna possesses even greater transcendental power than He does
Himself. Exactly for this reason being the internal energy of the
enjoyment of Krishna, Śrīmatī Radharani occupies, we can say, the top
position in games of the Lord.

For instance: Hare Krishna *Maha-mantra* begins with the word "Hare".
Hare – is an internal energy of Krishna, which Śrīmatī Radharani
personifies. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare /
Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

In other words: Radha Krishna, Radha Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Radha
Radha / Radha Syama, Radha Syama, Syama Syama, Radha Radha.

Thereby the potency of enjoyments always stands before Krishna.

For instance: Radha-Krishna; Sita-Rama; Lakshmi-Narayana.

Lord Caytanya ― is Krishna, He demonstrated the extreme manifestations
of love to God in marital relations. |SP| – is Śrīmatī
Radharani. He demonstrated the highest perfection of the ideal servant
of Krishna, showing limitless love and humility to Lord Krishna, as well
as enormous compassion and love to all conditioned living beings. And we
all can see it. |SP| is a perfect pure devotee - an ideal
servant of Krishna. He has shown us the highest ideal of devotion to the
Lord. With the example of his own life Prabhupada taught us how we
should live and serve Krishna with love in order to become absolutely
pure devotee of Lord Krishna. |SP| showing the qualities of
Śrīmatī Radharani felt enormous compassion and limitless love to all
living beings, the love, which could be always seen in His lotus eyes,
paved with the balm of love to the Lord. Totally giving oneself to the
loving service to Krishna, Prabhupada had only one single desire - to
awaken love to Lord Krishna in everyone and return home, back to God.

This was the main mission of Śrīmatī Radharani – to give everyone the
holy name of the Lord, so that the holy name of Lord Krishna would be
chanted in every city and every village.

We are all limited, but Lord is boundless and therefore we are not able
to understand the Lord with the power of our limited senses.
Consequently Krishna can only be realized through the\ *revelation*.
That what is beyond our perception, is called *acintja* –
*incomprehensible*. So, if we accept the transcendental knowledge
through the revelation, from the *direct representative* of Krishna, it
doesn’t matter anymore if it’s comprehensible or not.

So, without receiving the Radharani’s patronage and grace nobody can
serve Krishna. Every Hindu knows that. However |SP| never
stressed our attention on it. Why? Because |SP| – is Śrīmatī
Radharani Himself. If we surrender and serve |SP| – it means
we surrender and serve Radharani, since He is Radha. And to serve Radha
– means to serve Prabhupada. To become the servant of |SP| –
means to become a servant of Radharani, and thereby, the servant of
Krishna. This concludes our *guru-tattwa* and the one, who understands
this and accepts |SP| as a **bona fide** *diksha-guru*, will
be able to begin his loving service to Krishna. We should understand the
*guru-tattwa* and see the purpose - *Krishna-prema*, which we can find
by grace of the bona fide **sad-guru** - |SP| and in no
other ways.

*Prema-bhakti* can be developed only by grace of the **bona fide**
spiritual master |SP|. Our way – is *bhakti*, and our
purpose – *prema*, love. Krishna can only be tied up with the ropes of
love, which we can find only by grace of Radharani ― |SP|.

*|SP| says*: "ISKCON" is my body". If we want to understand
|SP| as He is, then we should *sincerely and all heartedly
enter into His spirit* and become a particla of His body (ISKCON), *take
on His mind set*, feel and understand His desires, which come from the
depth of his heart just like an odor of the sweet transcendental nectar
of *Krishna - prema* and only then, *completely devoting oneself* to Him
can we see His spiritual svarupa.

|SP| has reason to say that "ISKCON" is His body". The
Krishna Consciousness Movement (ISKCON) is purely spiritual Movement and
it’s not different from Krishna Himself, it’s one of the embodiments of
Krishna in the form of His holy name. |SP| is an embodiment
of Śrīmatī Radharani and is manifested in this Movement of Krishna
Consciousness, as well as Radha is. For this reason |SP|
identifies His transcendental body with this Worldwide Society "ISKCON",
since He is the manifestation of Radharani.

"The `Hare <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/h/hare>`__
`Krsna <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/k/krsna>`__ movement, is also an
incarnation of `Krsna <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/k/krsna>`__ in the

(S.B., 10.3.21.commentary)

*|SP| says*: "Krishna and Society of Krishna are not
different". (Dialectical spiritualist.)

Thereby in its essence "ISKCON" is nothing but the external
manifestation of |HDGSP|.

Without accepting the patronage of the **bona fide** guru |SP|,
nobody get’s the possibility to serve Krishna with love. We
can lifetime after lifetime follow the Vaiṣṇava tradition and perform
all the rituals, surrender to false gurus, but never get free from the
shackles of the material slavery.

*|SP| says*: "Life is meant for rendering devotional service
of the Lord under the guidance of a **bona fide acharya** –
representative of God. As soon as we understand it and dedicate
ourselves to carring out such a service, we are free. This is identified
as **mukti** - LIBERATION".

(Dialectical spiritualism)

Sincerely surrendering to the acharya - |HDGSP|, we find the unshakable faith and confidence that in the end
of our life we shall return to Krishna, and this confidence can be given
ONLY by the **bona fide**\ guru - |SP|. This confidence is
called the transcendental confidence.

*|SP| says*: “We therefore sing every day: *yasya prasadad
bhagavat-prasado (Sri Guru-astaka8).*\ The orders of God are carried out
by the *representative of God*, the spiritual master. When we have no
direct connection with God, the spiritual master serves as a
*transparent intermediary* between God and ourselves."

(Dialectical spiritualism)

*|SP| says*: "You can neither defy nor deny real authority.
We are presenting our Krishna consciousness movement on this principle.
We should carry out the orders of the authority , and Krishna, or God,
is the Supreme Authority. Whatever He says must be accepted without
interpretation. *So we must, follow the order of Krishna and*\ **His
representative**.”

(Dialectical spiritualism)

|SP| is a *direct representative* of Krishna. The great
deeds of Prabhupada speak for themselves. He is known in the whole
*Vayshnava* world as a great **sadhu**, the greatest companion of the
Lord Caytanya Mahaprabhu’s Mission. He is acknowledged by the scientists
from other sampradayas and other prominent *Vaiṣṇava acharyas*, which
you already know about. Unexcelled authority of |SP| is
*unshakeable*. All the instructions of the\ **representative**\ *of God*
should be accepted without any interpretation just like words of God.
However we can see that there are such people who dear not only to
interpret and reject the instructions of the **representative** of God,
but also change the holy scriptures of God.

In Bhagavad-gītā (16. 6.) Krishna says: “O son of Prtha, in this world
there are two kinds of created beings. One is called the divine and the
other demonic”.

In *satya-yuga* demons and demigods used to live on different planets,
in *treta-yuga* in different cities, in *dvapara-yuga* in different
ashrams and now in *kali-yuga* everything is mixed. Demons live even in
one family and one *ashram* with devotees. Therefore it is very
difficult for a simple person to tell who is who. They use all tricks to
delude the simple-hearted people.

*|SP| says*: "Sometimes penance and austerity are executed
to attract people and receive honor, respect and worship from others.
Persons in the mode of passion arrange to be worshiped by subordinates
and let them wash their feet and *offer riches.*..”

(B.g. 17.18. commentary)

There is one more example, Bhakta-das had a chance to see one procession
in Mayapur during the *vyāsa-puja* (birth day) of Jayapataka Maharaja,
who also unlawfully occupies the position of *diksha-guru* in spite the
fact that |SP| ordered him to be a *ritvik*.

Maharaja was splendidly sitting on the beautifully decorated
*vyasasana*, on the specially arranged scene. The arranged twisty queue
of his disciples was made into two-three rows, it could be seen on about
fifty meters and was constantly renewed with newcomers. The procession
actively advanced to the object to express the respect in the dandavat
and present the envelope, in most cases, with the minimum of one hundred
dollar bills or valuable gift. Maharaja impudently took the envelope,
and right then without even paying a look to it handed it over to his
secretaries, who immediately opened them, put the money into the
suitcase, threw the envelopes with the written congratulations into the
ash-bin standing nearby and placed the valuable gifts into the coffer,
specially prepared for this purpose. All this worked as perennial well
tuned conveyor out of few thousands of his disciples. And servants
helped Maharaja to accept the grants.

"The spiritual master must never be carried away by an accumulation of
wealth or a large number of followers. A bona fide spiritual master will
never become like that. But sometimes, if a spiritual master is not
properly authorized and only on his own initiative becomes a spiritual
master, he may be carried away by an accumulation of wealth and large
numbers of disciples."

("Nectar to devotion" ch.14 commentary)

How powerful is the desire of a living being to enjoy in this material
world. Everyone wants to occupy the position of God. Can really these
*people* willingly abandon their illegal titles of *diksha-gurus*, and
such a *guru-business*? This temptation pushes them to sinful actions,
forcing them to deceive all devotees, claiming to be the ones who they
actually are not. They are overpowered with greed under the influence of
illusion and do not understand that such gifts are like a free cheese in
a mousetrap. The time will come and bill will have to be paid. Nothing
is for free in this material world, everything has to be paid. In this
*Kali-yuga* there appeared a lot of self-appointed gurus, who dress in
cloths of *saniasy*\ and proclaim themselves a *diksha-guru* or even
Bhagavan.

"**This saffron dress has been misused by many imposters who present
themselves as liberated persons or incarnations of God. In this way
people are cheated**." (S.B. 4.19.12., commentary).

*|SP| says*: "All beings are trying to be happy in this
material world, but it is nature’s plan to give them trouble. In other
word, every attempt at happiness will be frustrated so that eventually
the living entity will turn to Krishna. This is the plan: to bring the
living entity back home, back to Godhead. This plan does not apply to
just a few living entities. It is not that some will remain here and
others will go back to Godhead. No, the whole plan is that everyone must
come back to Godhead. Some living entities are very obstinate, just like
bad boys. The father says: "Come on", but the boy says: "No, I’ll not
go". It is then the fathers business to drag him. At the end of
Bhagavad-gītā Krishna says:

Sarva-guhyatamain ghuyah srnu me paramam vacah

Isto’si me drdham iti tato vaksyami te hitam

"Because you are My very dear friend, I’m speaking to you the most
confidential part of knowledge. Hear this from Me, for it is for your
benefit.” (B.g. 18.64). Then He says: "surrender unto Me, and I will
give you all protection." (B.g.18.66). In Bhagavad-gītā, Krishna
instructed Arjuna in *karma-yoga*, *jnana-yoga* and other *yogas*, but
His final instruction was to surrender. *Prabhupada says:* "Authentic
truth is that God has a plan and person should learn this plan from the
one who knows it. One who acts under the guidance of acharya knows
everything about God".

(Dialectical spiritualism)

Actually none of these "gurus" knows God in reality and has an idea of
God’s plan. They rejected the instructions and guidance of the *acharya*
- the direct representative of God and act on their own whimsy,
interpreting the philosophy according to their own interests.

*|SP| says:* "Envy ― is a symptom of conditioned soul. In
this material world everyone is envious. People are even envious of God
and His instructions. Consequently, people do not like to accept
Krishna’s instructions. Although Krishna is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and is accepted as such by all acaryas, there are men called
*mudhas* who either reject Krishn’s instructions or try to eschew some
contrary meaning from them. This envy is sympthomatic of conditioned
souls. Unless we are liberated from conditioned life, we will remain
confused under the influence of the exsternal material energy. Until we
come to the spiritual platform, there is no possibility of escaping from
envy and pride by so-called power. The transcendental stage is described
in Bhagavad-gītā as *brahma-bhutah prasannatma samah sarvesu bhutesu
(18.54).*\ When we attain that stage, we can look at everyone with the
same spiritual understanding.”

(Dialectical spiritualism)

Sometimes we can see that some devotees are envious about someone who is
surrendering to |SP| and all powerfully tries to serve Him.

*Prabhupada says:* "Envy to other devotees is a big insult
(*Vaiṣṇava-apparatha*)."

(Dialectical spiritualism)

"Envious person in *Vaiṣṇava* cloths is not pleased with the success of
other *Vaiṣṇava* in achieving the favors of the God. Unfortunately,
there are many worldly people in this *Kali yuga*, dressed as Vaiṣṇavas
and Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur spoke of them as *Kali* disciples. He
called them *Kali-cela*. He indicates that there are other Vaiṣṇavas,
*pseudo-Vaiṣṇavas* with tilakas on the nose and beads (the kanthimalas)
around the neck. Such a pseudo-Vaiṣṇavas is connected with money, woman
and envies successfully advancing *Vaiṣṇavas*. Though he pretends to be
a *Vaiṣṇava*, *he is concerned with earning money in the cloths of
Vaiṣṇava*."

(Sri C. C., Madhya 1.218, commentary.)

Whatever kind of envy it were black or white, envy is envy and *Sastras*
advise us to get free from it. We should understandingly regard the
actions of such a devotee, who with determination raises the questions,
organizes debates, offers the settlement in the matter of guru and
initiation in ISKCON. Helping such a devotee we occupy the position of
the servant of the servant of the servant, that will certainly help us
in the spiritual progress. If we see, how other devotees spiritually
progress and feel sincere happiness for their success, we are completely
freed from the envy and thus begin to progress.

Krishna - is the *pavitram param* the purest among the pure\ *. To
approach the purest among the pure, it is necessary to become absolutely
pure*, therefore serious devotee sincerely strives for it.

Pure devotee doesn’t envy anyone and is impartial to all, he has no
enemy no friends, he is equally good to all and through the compassion
to everyone he is ready to give himself away for the sake of liberating
others.

*|SP| says*: "Those who are not envious of Krishna accept
His instructions, surrender unto Him, and understand Him. For them, this
is the last material birth. For those who are envious, however,
transmigration is continuous."

(Dialectical spiritualism)

Krishna and the Society of Krishna are not different from each other.
Showing our care and love to the Krishna Society and to each devotee
individually we are also freed from envy.

Sometimes it happens that Krishna takes everything away from His
devotee: home, property, money, relatives turn away from him, wife tells
him to leave, even so-called friends, who had seemingly same spiritual
interests, reject him. Then devotee thinks that Krishna is very hard on
him and falls into deep disappointment, and falls so deeply that finally
in this despair completely surrenders to Him. Thereby Krishna removes
all obstacles from his path to full and absolute devotion. This is how
Lord shows His special Mercy to His sincere bhakta.

Krishna says: "The one who is especially dear to Me, I gradually deprive
from all wealth".

When we despair, our faith in God strengthens and then we leave all
hopes for the material happiness.

*|SP| says:* "When one despairs, that is a great happiness.
Than everything is finished. All responsibility is gone, and the person
is relieved."

“It is therefore better that we learn to detest material existence and
try to give it up. *Param drstva nivartate (bg. 2.59)*\ The Vedas advise
us to understand the spiritual world and try to return there. *Tamasi ma
jyotir gama* The spiritual world ―is the kingdom of light, and this
material world ― is the kingdom of darkness. The sooner we learn to
avoid the world of darkness and return to the kingdom of light, the
better it is."

(Dialectical spiritualism)

To understand the spiritual world and come to know the way to return
there, it is necessary to address that personalities who knows this
world not from second hand, but is a direct representative of the
spiritual world. |SP| is the direct representative of the
spiritual world and He gives us full transcendental knowledge through
which each of us can become realized soul and return back home to God by
His mercy. For this it is necessary to completely surrender to |SP|,
the personality from which we get the transcendental
knowledge (*divya-jnana*). However the whole trouble is that we
surrender to self-appointed gurus (conditioned souls), who are not
representatives of the spiritual world and with all this, we want to
understand the transcendental knowledge reading |SP| books
without surrendering to Him. *This is impossible!*

*|SP| says*: "Understanding the
`Vedānta <http://vedabase.net/v/vedanta>`__-`sūtra <http://vedabase.net/s/sutra>`__
by academic knowledge never enables one to understand the *value of the
transcendental vibration*. People who are entangled in academic
knowledge are conditioned souls who are confused about the facts of
"**I**", "**mine**" and "**my**" understanding.”

("Teaching of Lord Caytanya ch.18)

In order to receive and understand the transcendental knowledge it is
necessary to address the **bona fide** spiritual master |SP|
becoming His disciple and the lowest servant, surrender and humbly
inquire Him, forgetting about the false pride, and consider oneself to
be the last fool before Him. Only in such a humble mind set it becomes
possible to understand and realize the knowledge given through the books
of |SP|, which are not different from Him.

However, we try to understand the transcendental knowledge just reading
|SP|’s books and not surrendering to Him but using our
imperfect mind and academic formation. Herewith giving it false
interpretation, this only baffles us and disturbs in understanding the
true importance of the transcendental vibration. In other words, person
who doesn’t want to surrender to the acharya, receiving the
transcendental knowledge from |SP|’s books, lets it flow
through his false ego, bringing into this knowledge his own mental
speculations, which tangle him even more. Since we are imperfect, our
interpretations are imperfect as well. At the best, knowledge received
in such a way, will be for us simply an information, food for mind.

Due to the good memory some people can go on speaking for hours on these
transcendental topics, quoting the shlokas from Bhagavad-gītā and
Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, become the good storyteller and thereby become known
as a great "pandit" (the scientist), but in the end this will not bring
any good neither to him nor to the ones who listen. Shrimad-Bhagavatam
should be heard from the mouth of pure devotee of Lord Krishna. Lectures
of |SP| recorded on video and audio cassettes are not
different from Him and we can use them, as well as His books.

Vibration which comes out of the mouth of pure devotee |SP|
- the direct representative of Krishna, continues to live regardless the
fact that its source is not accessible for us. One who doesn’t want to
surrender to acharya – the bona fide spiritual master, won’t accept it.
Thus the higher the academic formation the bigger the *false ego* is,
and this ego tells: You are so great, you have so much of information on
transcendental subjects, you can already become a guru and accept
disciples. Thereby *false ego* totally misleads him in understanding the
true meaning of one’s own "**I**".

*|SP|*: Superior ego says: "I am Brahman. I am the eternal
servant of Krishna". If we understand the self in this way, false ego
automatically vanishes. Our senses are gross, but they are controlled by
the mind. The mind is part of the subtle body, and the mind in turn is
controlled by the intelligence. The intelligence is controlled by the
ego, and if this ego is false, the entire structure is false. False ego
thinks: “I am this body”. This is false identification. When the ego is
thus deluded, everything subordinate to it is also illusioned because
everything else is standing on a false platform. Therefore the Vedas
advise us to come to the platform of knowledge, and thi sis called
*brahma-jnana.”*

(Dialectical spiritualism)

The one who has received an initiation from the **bona fide** spiritual
master and repeats *Maha-mantra*: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna
Krishna, Hare Hare / Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, is
gradually freed from the concept of "**I**" and "**my**" and develops
attachment to the transcendental loving service of the Lord.

*|SP| says*: "One who surrenders to bona fide spiritual
master, gradually comes out of the power of May (illusions)".

(Dialectical spiritualism)

Sri Caytanya Mahaprabhu says: (S.B. 10.14.3)

   *sthane sthitah sruti-gatam tanu-van-manobhir*

   *ye prayaso ‘jita jito ‘py asi tais tri-lokyam*

"Regardless what kind of guna man is influenced by – *rajas*, *tamas* or
*satva*, hearing Śrīmad Bhāgavatam everyday *retelled by
the*\ **self-realized**\ *person*, one can break free from the material
bondage"

In this verse Lord Caytanya Mahaprabhu recommends us to hear
Śrīmad Bhāgavatam from the mouth of pure devotee. |SP| is
that very personality, **self-realized**\ *soul*, who *retells* us the
Śrīmad Bhāgavatam in His books. One who takes these books in hands, gets
the possibility to communicate with |SP| and HEAR from His
mouth Śrīmad Bhāgavatam.

"**The influence of a pure devotee is such that if someone comes to
associate with him with a little faith, one gets the chance
of**\ **hearing**\ **about the Lord**\ **from authoritative
scriptures**\ **like
Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad Bhāgavatam ....This
is the first stage of association with pure devotee."**

("Nectar to Devotion" ch. 19)

It has been almost 30 years since ISKCON “gurus” rejected the last order
of |SP| (from July 9 1977) and act on their own whimsy,
initiating devotees with Hare Krishna *Maha-mantra* and *Gayatri mantra*
under their personal name, thereby predoom their own followers to run
the gantlet of the births in the material world.

**"...If everyone just initiates then there will be contradictory
result. As long as it goes on, there will be only failure".**

(|SP| Phalgun Krishnan Pancami, verse 23)

As it was already spoken above, *diksha-guru* must be the
*Maha-bhagavata* and get the special authorities from his spiritual
master (S.B., 4.8.54, commentary).

The one, who does not obey the orders of one’s guru, cannot become a
guru himself.

*|SP| says:* " If you stop obeying the guru, your practice
stops"

(Lecture of |SP| on Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 10 aug 1974)

Being in slavery of one’s *false ego*, person *cannot give* instructions
to others, not to mention the *Diksha*. Initiation is not simply a
mechanical procedure. Person who is giving *Diksha* should be a realized
personality, *sidha-purusha* of the mantra which he is giving, otherwise
these mantras will bring us *no result*. Practice shows that presently
devotees are coming to this understanding and accept |SP| as
**bona fide** *diksha-guru*.

*|SP| says:* "One’s first birth is by his father and mother,
and the next birth is by the spiritual master and Vedic knowledge. When
one takes his second birth, he comes to understand that he is not the
material body. That is spiritual education. That birth of knowledge, or
birth into knowledge is called *dvijah.*

(Dialectical spiritualism)

Reaching the level of *brahma-bhuta* devotee is freed from all material
desires and regrets, thereby he becomes joyful and feels satisfaction in
himself, he becomes able to look at all living beings with one and same
spiritual understanding. Self-realized soul completely realizes the
Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna and his relations with Him
(*svarupa*). Such a personality is free from false ego (illusions) and
acts only to satisfy the Lord, according to his spiritual nature - an
eternal servant of the Lord Krishna. To reach this transcendental level
is only possible through the mercy of the **bona fide** spiritual master
― |SP|, through serving Him with love.

*|SP| says:* "One who is advanced in bhakti is no longer
interested in material enjoyment. Unless we come to detest material
things, it is to be understood that we are not making progress. When a
hungry man eats, he feels satisfied, and his body gains strength.
Similarly when we advance in Krishna consciousness, we feel spiritually
strong and lose our taste for material enjoyment."

(Dialectical spiritualism)

from all the problems created in this age of
`Kali <http://srimadbhagavatam.com/k/kali>`__\ *.*\ ”

(S.B. 9.24.56.commentary)

*|SP| says*: "The main purpose of Lord Caytania Mahaprabhu’s
appearance in this world was to show people how they can connect oneself
to Supreme Personality of Godhead with loving relations. Therefore
Krishna consciousness movement is a great boon for human society, as it
presents lucky possibility to abandon this material world by simply
repeating *mantra* Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare
Hare, / Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare."

(Dialectical spiritualism)

This *Maha mantra* is given to us by |HDGSP| -
the **bona fide** spiritual master, *direct representative* of Krishna.
And only by His mercy we can restore our relations with Krishna. It is
very important to understand!

*|SP| says*: "Similarly, we can offer many services with our
bodily activities. But all such activities must be in relationship with
`Kṛṣṇa <http://nectarofdevotion.com/k/krsna>`__. This relationship is
established by connecting oneself with the **bona fide** spiritual
master, who *is the*\ **direct representative
of**\ `Kṛṣṇa <http://nectarofdevotion.com/k/krsna>`__\ *in disciplic
succession*. Therefore, the execution of
`Kṛṣṇa <http://nectarofdevotion.com/k/krsna>`__ conscious activities
with the body should be directed by the spiritual master and then
performed with faith. The connection with the spiritual master is called
initiation. From the date of initiation by the spiritual master, the
connection between `Kṛṣṇa <http://nectarofdevotion.com/k/krsna>`__ and a
person cultivating `Kṛṣṇa <http://nectarofdevotion.com/k/krsna>`__
consciousness is established. Without initiation by a **bona
fide**\ spiritual master, the actual connection with
`Kṛṣṇa <http://nectarofdevotion.com/k/krsna>`__ consciousness i\ *s
never performed*."

("Nectar to devotion" intriduction)

As we already know, initiation – means to initiate the disciple with the
transcendental knowledge (*divya-jnana*), which we get from |SP|
through His books, *which present Him.*

In the Nectar of devotion it is also said: "Because Krishna is Supreme
Personality of Godhead, it is very difficult to approach Him. But
devotees address His compassionate nature, which is personified by
Radharani and always pray to Her for Krishna’s compassion".

This once again confirms all that was already described above. Only by
mercy of Radharani person can approach Krishne. Radha and Krishna are
not different from each other. |SP| is and embodiment of
Śrīmatī Radharani and therefore is not different from Her and thus not
different from Krishna. This kind of incarnations like |SP|
comes to material world once in *thousand kali-yugas*.

Since |SP| is an embodiment of Śrīmatī Radharani He is even
more compassionate and merciful, than Lord Caytanya Himself. Without
expecting anything back Sri Caytanya Mahaprabhu kindly distributed
*Krishna-prema* ― love to God to everyone (in the form of chanting the
holy name of Lord), but it wasn’t easy for everyone to approach Him.
Being a sanyasi He was quite strict to His devotees, we can see it from
the event with Haridas.

As an incarnation of Radharani |SP| shows the highest
humility and compassion to all conditioned souls. Just like a magnet He
attracts to Himself the most fallen and like philosophical stone
transforms them into devotees of Lord Krishna. By the unconditional
mercy of |SP|, each person can easily approach Him and
communicate with Him, it is enough to just sincerely take His book in
hands. Just like loving father takes care of all his children, making no
difference, so does Prabhupada with all his love takes care of all souls
that have sincerely devoted to Him and always dwells in their hearts
with the ray of the knowledge illuminating way home, back to God.

It is a great happiness to be born in this kali-yuga in the human life
form and meet in one’s life the greatest personality - |HDGSP|.
By sincerely surrendering to Him as a **bona fide**
spiritual master, person get one hundred percent warranty for coming
back to God. Like Krishna is obliged with the love of one’s devoted to
Him, rather than service as such, so |SP| most of all values
*sincerity* of the souls who have surrendered to Him and this makes Him
obliged. Just like Krishna can be tied with the ropes of love, in the
same way |SP| can be tied forever with us, if we sincerely
give ourselves to Him. Radhika – Prabhupada is a boundless ocean of
mercy and compassion to all fallen conditioned souls.

|SP| is our eternal Guru. Out of compassion and enormous
love He appeared to this world specially to pick us up. Therefore we
should not waist our precious time in vain. In this age of Kali we are
so short of time, life is so penny-ante, any moment it can come to an
end. Our senses are like mad horses and mind like a wandering madman in
darkness. We should surrender and give oneself to |HDGSP| right\ *with the word*. Thus we shall deliver enormous
pleasure to our beloved eternal Gurudev. And with no doubt we shall very
soon find the inner happiness and unflinching confidence that at the end
the life we shall return to Lord Krishna.

|SP| is accused in INATTENTIVENESS
============================================================================

Reports from Bangalore boardroom meetings of His Holiness Jayapataka
Swami, local GBC, with the Bangalore temple devotees –

**Part 1**

We took this time to transcribe all the lengthy discussions we had with
Maharaj. We are only presenting the highlights of the talk. Interested
readers please send your responses for the entire transcription
material, send your responses to goloka@vsnl.com

1. Is It Offensive to Discuss ISKCON's Guru Issue?

It is sometimes argued that a devotee in ISKCON is turning offensive
when he discusses a view that opposes the currently held GBC views on
the subject of the constitutional status of an ISKCON guru. This opinion
is more intensely extended by its supporters to situations when a
devotee challenges or refutes viewpoints held by the person who has
formally initiated him and as a result, is conventionally understood to
be his guru. And hence, right at the outset, we find it extremely
relevant to point out that such an opinion holds no water for the
following clear reasons:

a. The very subject of the constitutional status of the ISKCON guru is
under great discussion, (at least since two decades now) with a wide
cross-section of devotees contributing their views, including the
members of the GBC. Though the efforts of the ISKCON's topmost body the
GBC (consisting of highly qualified & capable individuals) to present a
"final siddhanta" on the above issue have since the early 80's been
steadily consistent and appreciable (resulting in a fair number of
papers), the fact remains undisputed that even today no GBC
understanding exists on this matter which can be honored with the
adjectives such as
"`final <http://www.iskconirm.com/gbc_fail_to_answer_the_final_order.htm>`__"
or "conclusive". Adding to the point made above, it may be worthwhile to
note that even amongst the individual members of the GBC differences of
opinion prominently exist on various details of the above subject, with
certain GBC members even fully subscribing to the view (considered by
other GBC members as directly opposing theirs) that |SP|'s
`July 9th <http://www.iskconirm.com/tfo.htm#July>`__ directive to
conduct initiations using the ritvik system was his permanent directive
to do the same.

b. Devotees who join ISKCON seeking sincere spiritual guidance (many of
them after rejecting bright material careers), with genuine concern for
the expanding the movement of their beloved Master |SP|,
whose words and activities have created revolutions in their living and
thinking possess an undisputed prerogative to bring up and discuss
matters they feel very relevant to establishing the well-being of an
otherwise "fast drowning" ISKCON of today.  Having stated the above, we
honourably appeal to all interested parties to judge the actions of a
devotee who indulges in raising questions, organizing discussions,
proposing solutions or seeking alternatives in the subject matter of
Gurus and Initiations in ISKCON, with radical fair-mindedness. At this
juncture, the words of |HDGSP| will throw
further light on the point we are trying to make:

"Everything will become clear if you kindly read this chapter with
attention. For example, we see that two lawyers in the courtroom may
fight vigorously about a law point, but upon returning to the law
library, they talk and embrace like friends. So you should always
remember that we have no ill feelings towards Vallabha Bhattacarya. We
have full respect for him, so there is no harm if these facts are
discussed in the society of devotees. Devotees always humbly offer
respect to everyone, but when there is a discussion on a point of
sastra, they do not observe the usual etiquette, satyam bruyat priyam
bruyat. They speak only the satyam, although it may not necessarily be
priyam."

And therefore, conscious as we remain of the possibility that our words
may not necessarily be priyam and that our behaviour may be interpreted
as a breach of etiquette, we nevertheless proceed, having taken shelter
of the above advice given by |SP|, with undying
determination to humbly present what we have come to understand as the
best and most practical solution for this most crucial problem
confronting ISKCON today - simply restore the system for future
initiations in ISKCON that |SP| himself established before
his departure.

2. A GBC should at least know the ABC's.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The December '98 visit of His Holiness `Jayapataka
Swami <http://www.iskconirm.com/reply_to_his_holiness__jayapataka.htm>`__,
local GBC, saw three intense meetings with the Bangalore temple
devotees, on the ongoing issue of gurus and initiations in ISKCON.
During these meetings, the temple devotees presented their views on the
matter (most of which conforming to what is commonly known as
"ritvik-vada"), which they had formed after several months of study and
research on the subject. Taking extreme care to avoid offences to any
individual or group, devotees placed before His Holiness their
conclusions supported by clear logic & reasoning. The devotees
ultimately requested His Holiness to revert back to his original role of
a ritvik, assigned to him by |HDGSP| and
promised him full support and co-operation in executing it efficiently
in Bangalore. Quite unexpectedly however, an additional flavour was
introduced in the mood of the discussions as His Holiness issued certain
statements - statements which in themselves could trigger additional
controversies and could aptly be termed "highly debatable". Presented
below are these very statements that His Holiness made, in attempts to
defend his views, which we strongly oppose. Pretty soon, it became clear
to the devotees present (as we can see at the end of this essay) that it
would be impossible to make much ground in these discussions primarily
because the person with whom they were discussing, though the GBC of the
area, was not himself very clear in his own understanding on the
subject. It may again be emphasized that our attempt to set things right
in ISKCON may not be misconstrued as expressions of any personal grudge
against anyone in general or His Holiness Jayapataka Swami in
particular. Our obeisance's to |HDGSP| and all
the Vaiṣṇavas.

ON THE PHRASE "MY INITIATED DISCIPLE" IN |SP|'S FINAL WILL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Часть первая
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2A. Please examine the following extract from the recordings of the 2nd
day of the meetings. The question under discussion was about the use of
the words "my initiated disciple" in `|SP|'s
Will <http://www.iskconirm.com/tfo.htm#Will>`__, which Jayapataka
Maharaja explained actually was a result of the "spaced-out" condition
of the disciples who compiled the will.

**Jayapataka Swami:**

The Will is not even personally compiled by |SP|. Actually,
it was compiled by Giriraj. There's a discussion which was recorded on
2nd June 1977. Giriraj says 'so we drafted a Will including the Trust
with the properties of India and some of the other'..... it continues...
Why the devotees added the words 'my initiated disciple' in a final text
is an interesting little story. On May 27th the devotees read the first
draft to |SP|. For Vrindavan, the draft proposed 3 trustees
including Viswambar Dayal, better known as Bharatji a friend of ISKCON
who helped in Vrindavan. The following discussion ensued (reads out from
a |SP| conversation extract from the folio):

**Devotee:** 'Prabhupada, Viswambar is not a regular disciple.

**Jayapataka:** shouldn't be included.

**Prabhupada:** then he has to accept Sanyas from me.

**Jayapataka:** Trustee must be initiated disciple.

**Prabhupada:** Oh yes.

You see in that discussion, I said that the trustee should be an
initiated disciple. I didn't say Prabhupada disciple or any disciple. I
just said 'initiated'. Prabhupada said yes. This is actually what was
agreed by Prabhupada... So why didn't they use more appropriate words?
We asked Giriraj Maharaj and he said we won't use far thinking like
that. In retrospect it's very naïve. At that time because there were
only Prabhupada's disciples, (we) didn't think about it. That's his
mistake. So Giriraj says we were all spaced out. We were all like that.
So to claim a "space out" is indication does not really hold out.

**Comments**: Pray, what are we to make out of this completely
innovative explanation of Jayapataka Maharaja in the matter of usage of
words in |SP|'s will?

Should we take it that since the compilers of the Final Will were
actually "spaced-out", the entire Will may also not be taken seriously?

Or, since |SP| was apparently assisted by "spaced-out"
disciples even when he was sometimes doing very critical things like
drafting the Will, we should henceforward become very wary of what we
read in |SP|'s books and other documents which were also
produced with the assistance of other disciples of His Divine Grace?

Or, should we directly infer that the very same disciples (such as
Giriraja Swami, Jayapataka Swami etc.) who "spaced-out" in a critical
service such as drafting their spiritual master's Final Will in his very
presence, have shortly after his departure confidently assumed the role
of the next acarya also as a result of being "spaced-out"?

Or, should it be taken as a claim by maharaja that although such
"spaced-out" disciples surrounded |SP|, he let things happen
the way they were happening, being incapable of judging the
consequences?

Часть вторая
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


2B. Though His Holiness created a lot of room for such doubts by
inappropriate usage of words, devotees nonetheless sought polite
clarification from him:  

**Rajiva Locana Dasa:** Yes. But maharaj, they knew that Will is meant
for the future. In spite of that they should have been careful. We see
at another point Prabhupada changes one of the items of the Will. In the
second line he does that. That means he was very much aware of what they
were writing. When you know that pensions were given to his parents or
wife, he says in the first one, that in the first Will "I have written
its not very clear". Then he gets it written once again. That means that
Prabhupada was definitely aware. It's (the will is) not "just
authorized" by Prabhupada. It's a confirmation.

**Bhakta Mitesh:** He must have read the Will many times.

**Jayapataka Swami:** I just read it out to him once and he said "okay"
and signed it. You know he was...

**Rajiva Locana Dasa**: But even if he's heard it once, and has accepted
it, he's an acharya, and he must be hearing it properly otherwise how
would he remember to change something later on? So his intelligence was
so sharp as an acharya, as a Mahabagavatha (unclear)...we are under
mining Prabhupada. It is a well documented and acknowledged fact that
|SP| was extremely meticulous and scrutinisingly perfect in
all his devotional activities and this fact is amply demonstrated in all
his dealings all through the years. As anyone can clearly see from the
above piece of the conversation, even if his disciples were actually
"spaced-out" as stated by His Holiness, |SP| would never
make the mistake of approving something he was not sure of, especially
an item as critical as his Final Will and for this simple reason alone,
the words "my initiated disciple" may please be taken AS THEY ARE.

Часть третья
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


2C. Next, Maharaja strongly suggested, using the example of a witness in
a courtroom, that since he was personally present while the Will was
drafted, his interpretation of the Will's words may be accepted by us,
instead of taking |SP|'s words directly.

**Vedanta Chaitanya Dasa:** Maharaj, do you mean to say that everything
Prabhupada said or spoke about is to be understood only through the
people who were around him? It amounts to saying that we have to first
understand the mood of the devotees who "understood" Prabhupada rather
than Prabhupada himself and his speaking so directly present in his
books. Speaking so nicely in his instructions. It looks like...

**Jayapataka Swami:** You have to take both the things together. If you
don't take both the things together, then just the books, you won't get
the same idea as all the impression as the people who were with him.
There are so many quotations where Prabhupada said that why do we have
university. We don't only read the books. We also need a teacher. This
is why the system of Guru parampara is there because you need a teacher.
To learn clearly the science, get the order and go on. Whether you are
Siksha Guru or Diksha Guru. But that parampara system should be there.
And that system, that is what why we accept Giriraj Maharaj's point or
why we accept the point of the people who were there because that's the
system. Even in a court of law who is the eye witness, you should accept
what they say.

**Kunjavihari Dasa:** I would like to make 4 points. First thing - you
were saying why we are complicating 'my initiated disciples'. There is
nothing complicated. Directly we understand my initiated disciples' as
Prabhupada's disciples. There is no complication as far as the
understanding is concerned. The second one is - we can either ask
Giriraj Maharaj or take your version of what you have understood. But
Prabhupada never says in his Will that an arbitrator is required to
understand Prabhupada. He never mentions that "you go to such and such
maharaj or such and such sanyasi to understand my Will. Otherwise you
will not be able to understand." The third one is - you were saying we
were not agreeing to that May 28th conversation - pertaining to that.
But, we are agreeing to that. In his presence you cannot become Diksha
Guru. But that does not mean that as soon as he leaves the planet - in
his physical absence, you can become a Diksha Guru. Nowhere Prabhupada
says that.

**Jayapataka Swami:**\ Nowhere he said that. No where he said that in
the absence of a guru, the disciple has the right to initiate.

**Chanchalapati Dasa:** In the statement of formality, the etiquette,
which he mentioned, Acharyapad, does not imply after the disappearance
of the guru, the disciple can automatically become a guru.

**Jayapataka Swami:** He needs an order.

Our dearest Jayapataka maharaja, is this an attempt to introduce a new
idea in this movement that we cannot understand |SP|'s
books,  without approaching you or anyone else? Where from has this
concoction taken birth? To the best of our knowledge, |SP|
never declared this anywhere.

A How do you account for the fact that thousands of devotees (including
probably your good self) have received / are receiving incomparable
spiritual inspiration from the books given by |SP|

B In what other way, do you interpret |SP|'s own statement
issued to a press reporter (who had inquired about the future of the
movement after |SP|'s departure) "I will never die... I
shall live from my books and you will utilize." than in the direct sense
in which it exists. Pray, enlighten the whole world and us with your
realizations.

C Should we understand that ever since |SP| terminated his
physically manifest pastimes amongst us, we can assume "he's dead and
gone" and start preaching deviant philosophies, completely against
well-established ISKCON siddhanta?  

Часть четвёртая
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


2D. Maharaja next went on to defend his explanation that |SP| 
never noticed "My initiated disciple" by saying that a pure
devotee may not really be free from defects.

**Devotee:** A pure devotee is run by Krishna. His senses are directed
by Krishna  

**Jayapataka Swami:** You are trying to make that pure devotee is
Krishna? 

**Devotee:** We are not saying that. He is directed by Krishna. Is free
from all defects. Yes.

**Jayapataka Swami:** How does it say that free from all defects?

**Devotee:** Pure devotees are free...

**Jayapataka Swami:** What it means is that everything he is doing for
the pleasure of Krishna. There is also a quote when we see...that
sometimes guru is falling asleep or when he is giving a class he misses
a Sanskrit verse or something. Or we hear a Guru is free from all
defects...you don't understand. That's not what it means. It's not that
he is free from all defects. The point is that everything the he's doing
is for the service of Krishna. That is what it means pure devotee.
Everything he's doing is for Krishna.

**Devotee:**\ Prabhupada was a mahabhagavatha. We all know that he was
empowered by the Lord only for this mission and such a type of devotee -
his words are dictated by the Lord.

**Devotee:** In Bhagavad Gita, 1st Chapter where the word Hrishikesha is
used, in connection with that Prabhupada very clearly mentions that for
a pure devotee, the Lord directly controls and directs the senses. Very
clearly he mentions that. For a non-devotee according to their surrender
He might direct them. Just like He's giving that example - just like
Arjuna was directly...his senses were directly controlled by the Lord.
So he may have made mistakes, but that was also according to the
instructions of the Lord.   Here is an example of how sometimes, one is
dragged into making irrelevant statements, sometimes offensive to one's
own guru, just to defend one's own position or views. Although being in
a senior and very responsible position as a GBC member, His Holiness is
here trying to establish that one is wrong if one thinks that |SP|
(though he does not dispute the understanding that |SP|
was a pure devotee, mahabhagavatha etc.) was free from
defects because he could make mistakes such as falling asleep in a class
(has anyone seen this anytime, we only know that |SP| was
always very alert?) or missing Sanskrit verses. And this is the
explanation His Holiness has, just to prove his point that |SP|
did not notice the "my" in the phrase "my initiated disciple"
in his Final Will. Maharaja, have you come to accept at least now (after
hearing the most appropriate reasons provided by the devotees
assembled), the fact that a pure devotee such as |SP| is
indeed free from all defects? Please do not hesitate to take our help -
we remain faithfully at your service.

2E. And Next, Maharaja Contradicts Himself !!!

After maharaja had exhausted several possible explanations of the "my
initiated disciple" phrase to justify his position as a regular diksha
guru, he made yet another try, this time however, directly contradicting
what he had himself stated some time earlier in the same meeting. Please
read on:  

**Chanchalapati Dasa:** ... and all Prabhupada's disciples go away, then
anyone can take over the property. (Here Chanchalapati Dasa is trying to
question as to what would happen to the trusteeship of the movement's
properties after all the "Prabhupada disciples" pass away.)

**Jayapataka Swami:** "My initiated disciples" you could also interpret
to mean that by "siksha disciple who is initiated by me".

**Devotees:** ...(uproar) (unclear) (devotees disapprove maharaja's
sudden speculation).

**Jayapataka Swami:** By your association I'm getting crazy.

**Dear maharaja, long before you realized that you were going crazy did
you ever consider the possibility that we the devotees of ISKCON
Bangalore, were also being driven crazy by your fast changing
interpretations on the same matter?**

a. How is it that just a few minutes earlier in the meeting you had very
   confidently explained that the word "my" was never meant to be a part
   of the currently existing "my initiated disciple" and all of a
   sudden, out of the blue, you decided that "my" is very much part of
   the same phrase, and it actually refers to |SP|'s siksha
   disciples? Please be merciful & share with us the secret behind this
   realization that you just had. Maybe, Maharaja, You should first
   decide whether the word "my" is an inadvertent, accidental inclusion
   or is it actually refer to a siksha disciple?

b. Or, maharaja, do you actually feel that our guru maharaja's Final
   Will is a document on which you can freely exercise your speculations
   and draw interpretations to suit your whims according to time, place
   and circumstance and mislead other innocent devotees? Why not simply
   accept it As It Is? What is the real difficulty?

c. Or, maharaja, don't you really appreciate how it is imperative to
   find a long awaited fool-proof solution to ISKCON's much battered
   Guru & Initiation system, certainly due to which millions of dollars,
   thousands of devotees, all good name and position has been snatched
   away from this wonderful movement given to us by |SP|?
   Oh! our good friend Jayapataka Maharaja, do you possess any
   perception of how valuable our time in this human form of life is,
   certainly not meant to be wasted in pointless & frivolous discussions
   in boardrooms at the cost of our devotional service to Sri Sri Radha
   and Krishnachandra? We certainly do. Please do let us know if you
   opine to differ. Thank you very much.

   In conclusion of this part of
   our analysis, let us all together take shelter of - that one
   wonderful personality who instructed us in practical matters of
   spiritual science even up to his last breath, in this episode of his
   manifest pastimes and is still instructing us through his glorious
   instructions - His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.
   And as we sign out, let's turn back the clock and take a quick peep
   at a touching scene that took place a fair while ago.

**Venue:** |SP|'s house, Sri Krishna Balarama Mandir,
Vrindavana

**Date:** 3rd November 1977 (11 days before |SP| departed)

**Krsna dasa Babaji**: It is wonderful that he is speaking so nicely,
with full sense.

**Bhakti-caru:** He's saying that it's wonderful that you are in full
consciousness.

**|SP|:** He doesn't expect this consciousness in this
condition. Therefore he is astonished. Actually, physically--finished,
everything. So where from the voice coming and where from intelligence
coming? That he is astonished

**Samadhis of sinful souls on the holy land**
============================================================================

The word “Samadhi” means full concentration of the mind on the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Samadhi is such a level of consciousness, when
devotee constantly dwells on Krishna with his mind by means of
meditation. Here can be brought an example of a perfect Samadhi of our
acharya – His Divine Grace Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada. Every second,
twenty four hours a day he was absorbed in thoughts about Lord Krishna,
Chaitanja Mahaprabhu, His mission and his spiritual master, how to
distribute Krishna consciousness in whole world. This is what perfect
Samadhi is.

There is another meaning of the word *Samadhi* as well – when the bodies
of great devotees of Lord Krishna are consigned to the earth and there
simple or ornamented stone structures are established on the top, they
are called *Samadhi-mandirs*\ or simply *Samadhi.*\ Mostly
*samadhis*\ are of three types: with the whole body inside – simple
(standard), *pushpa*\ (flowery) and *smriti (*\ memorial).

When the death comes, Vaiṣṇava who has attained the perfection, enters
the state of meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead –
*Samadhi.* Having dived into *Samadhi*, completely disattaching oneself
from the material body by means of the higher consciousness of one’s
true “I”, he leaves this body. Therefore perfect devotee do not die in
the common meaning of this word – he “enters the *Samadhi*\ ”.

|SP| was constantly residing in the state of *Samadhi*,
active and physical absorbance into loving service to Krishna. And when
the time came to die, He taught all of us an instructive lesson, how do
perfect Vaiṣṇava leave his body. |SP| left his body twice.
Thus he let us understand that he doesn’t leave this world under duress,
as all conditioned souls do, but according to Lords plan. When first
time |SP| left the body, those devotees who were near Him
that moment, were much distressed, cried and were pleading Him to stay
and not to leave them. |SP| heard their prays, returned
again into His body and said: “Well, you here cry and pray to Me to stay
with you, but there behind the wall, they don’t want me to stay and pray
that I should leave sooner.”

“He reasons ill who tells that Vaisnavas die When thou are living still
in sound!”

(Bhaktivinoda Thakura)

Few days later on 14 November 1977 staying in holy dhama Vrindavana
|HDGSP| left this planet.

“If I depart there is no cause for lamentation. I will always be with
you through my books and orders. I will always remain with you in that
way.”

(“Back to God” 13:1-2 dec. 1977)

The transcendental body of His Divine Grace Sri-Srimad A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada,
acharya-founder of International Society
of Krishna Consciousness “ISKCON” repose in Vrindavana, in a magnificent
hand carved *Samadhi*\ of pure white marble near Krishna-Balaram temple.
And |SP|’s *pushpa-samadhi*\ is located in Sri-dhama
Mayapura. It is a very big and beautiful *Samadhi* topped with huge
white marble cupola and decorated with gigantic radiant sculptures. In
its splendor |SP|s *Samadhi*\ beautifies Ganges bank. This
*Samadhi*\ can be seen from many kilometers around.

Commonly in India, bodies of common people are incinerated, but bodies
of great saints are not, they are placed into *samadhis*, since body of
such a *Vaiṣṇava* – is *chin moja* (spiritual).

Samadhis along with the Krishna temples have great importance in
spiritual life of devotees. They come to temple to get a darshan and
enjoy the indescribable beauty of the Lord. Devotees fall in dandavat
before deities, they dance and sing holy names of the Lord, for His
pleasure. Thus they render a direct service to God, which promotes
purification and quick spiritual growth. And when devotees come to the
*samadhis*\ of great devotees they also get a darshan of this
*Vaiṣṇava*. Bowing low to him devotees render service onto him offering
fire, water, flowers and glorify chanting his names. Thereby they
receive the mercy and blessings of this *Vaiṣṇava* for the spiritual
progress.

Our ISKCON pseudo gurus are not great saints, however their deceived
followers guided by GBC are also setting up *samadhis*\ for these sinful
bodies. In Sri-dhama Mayapura near the |SP| *Samadhi*\ GBC
leaders have prepared a big piece of land for the *samadhis*\ of those
self-appointed gurus, who would be dying. When Bhakta-das was staying in
Sri-dhama Mayapura, he happened to witness one unsavory seen.

Not long before Sridhara Maharaja left his body, surrounded by his
disciples he was walking towards the already existing *samadhis.*\ He
was badly ill and for this reason could hardly walk. His disciples were
walking next to him and were carrying a chair for him, on which Maharaja
sat from time to time. When they approached the place where
*samadhis*\ are placed Sridhara Maharaja took a seat on a chair, one of
his disciples asked him to point out the place for his grave site.
Sridhara Maharaja pointed with a hand the place where his body was later
buried with a *Samadhi* built on the top. This is how these pseudo
*sadhus* want to perpetuate themselves in the eyes of their followers,
just like people establish monuments on the grave yards of their
relatives. These so called “sadhus”, conditioned souls, are motivated by
the desire of self-exaltation. Their sinful bodies are spreading
unfavorable energy of contaminating character.

In contrary with this we shall bring one example of a true *sadhu*\ who
is a representative of our chain of disciplic succession – that is Srila
Gaurakisora das Babaji Maharaja, the Bhaktisidhanta Sarasvati Thakur’s
spiritual master. Before leaving his body he said: “When I leave this
perishable body, tie it with ropes and drag it through all the streets
of the holy Navadvipa Dhama, to purify it with the dust from the feet of
the devotees of the Lord. This is the only way I can purify myself.” As
we know from above described this Great soul Srila Gaurakisora dasa
Babaji Maharaja is *radha-prija-sakhi* beloved maid of Śrīmatī
Radharani. He pronounced these words out of deepest humbleness. This is
such an exulted soul, that even Krishna-Chandra Himself is ready to
carry him on His head. Hallows of such a person purify everything around
with their energy.

In conclusion we want to say that there are already four *samadhis*
built for these conditioned sinful souls pseudo ISKCON gurus.

1. Tamala Krishna Maharaja, *Samadhi* (standard) 2002; located in
   Sri-dhama Mayapura. Died in awful car accident in Calcutta city.

2. Gour Govinda Maharaja, *Samadhi* (standard) 1996; located in
   Bhubaneshvar (Orissa state). His *pushpa-samadhi* is located in
   Sri-dhama Mayapura. (died from cancer).

3. Sridhara Maharaja, *Samadhi* (standard) 2004; located in Sri-Dhama
   mayapura. (died from cancer).

4. Bhakti Tirtha Maharaja, *Samadhi* (standard) 2004; located in USA.
   His *pushpa-samadhi* is located in Sri-dhama Mayapura (died from
   cancer).

As we can see almost all these unauthorized gurus died from this
horrible disease – cancer. As a general rule people die from such a
disease as a result of their sinful karma.

*|SP| says*: Devotee *should not* suffer from diseases like:
AIDS, syphilis, cancer, tuberculosis.

Even though they were all chanting the holy names of God, still they
were not able to free oneself and even worse, gained such a sinful
karma. The question comes, why? Don’t holy names of God release from all
sins? In Bhagavad gita 18.66 Lord promises:
`ahaḿ <http://vedabase.net/a/aham>`__\ `tvāḿ <http://vedabase.net/t/tvam>`__\ `sarva <http://vedabase.net/s/sarva>`__\ *-pāpebhyo*\ `mokṣayiṣyāmi <http://vedabase.net/m/moksayisyami>`__\ `mā <http://vedabase.net/m/ma>`__\ `śucaḥ <http://vedabase.net/s/sucah>`__\ *–“I
shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear*.” Having
accepted the Lord Krishna’s patronage one finds the most reliable
protection. This kind of protection we can only get by the unconditioned
mercy of either Supreme Lord Himself or His direct representative – bona
fide Guru and no other way. As these gurus have gone against the
instructions of the acharya, they are reaping the fruits of their past
sinful karma and get reactions for the presently caused sins. To go
against the instructions of the acharya is the greatest sin.

*|SP| says*: “Spiritual master is obliged to take
responsibility for the sins of his disciple and partly pay for his sins.
Krishna being merciful to His servant neutralizes the effects of sinful
actions.”

Because unauthorized ISKCON gurus self-willingly occupied the positions
of diksha-gurus, moved by the desires of power, glory, money and self
worship, they pay a high price for it. Almost all of them are badly
suffering from diseases for their sins and sins of their disciples. The
mercy of the Lord do not cover such self-appointed gurus.

Послесловие
============================================================================

Ранее автор не указывал первую часть своего имени в этой книге
а подписывался как \"Прабхупа̄да дас\", т.е. слуга Прабхупа̄ды. Почему так?

В 1999 году Ягьясена прабху признался Ниранджане Махараджу что он для него 
не является *дӣкша̄-гуру*. А *дӣкша̄-гуру* для него является |ШПа|. 
После чего Ниранджана Свами приказал президенту московского храма на "Беговой"
наложить запрет на посещение храма Ягьясеной прабху. 
А позже этот запрет расширился до всех храмов |ISKCON| в России.

В 2005 году, по приезду в Индию в Бангалорском храме Ягьясена прабху получил
брахманическую инициацию перед мурти |ШПы|, которую организовал Мадху Пандит прабху. 

По возвращении в Москву Ягьясена прабху начал писать книгу. По милости |ШПы| и Кр̣шн̣ы
к 110-летию явления |ШПы| книга была завершена и представлена Его божественным стопам в московском храме.

После чего Ягьясена прабху сам распечатывал листы на принтере в формате А4, 
вручную делал книгу "Истинный Гуру" и распространял среди своих хороших знакомых преданных.
За такую проповедь ему грозились расправой преданные из *Гаўдӣйа-мат̣ха*.

В 2008 году он перевел эту книгу на английский язык и напечатал на принтере 10 экземпляров.
После этого поехал в Индию на праздник Гаура-Пурнимы и раздавал эти книги англоязычным преданным из разных стран.
Каким-то образом книга оказалась в администрации |ISKCON|, после чего 
к нему пришли один преданный из администрации с полицией и переводчицей.
Они без разрешения осмотрели все вещи в надежде найти книги  "Истинный Гуру".
Но ничего не нашли, предупредив Ягьясену прабху, что если поступит
ещё одна жалоба за подобную проповедь и книги -- то будут приняты меры.
Они пригрозили ему отобрать квартиру и выгнать из |ISKCON| за нарушение режима.

По возвращении в Москву Ягьясена прабху продолжил печатать самодельные книги на принтере в формате А4 и 
распространял их, проповедуя о |ШПе| как о единственном **истинном** *дӣкша̄-гуру* |ISKCON|.
Он был вынужден скрывать своё имя и подписывался \"Прабхупа̄да дас\". 
На самом деле мы все являемся слугами Прабхупа̄ды.

Распространяя книги и проповедуя о Прабхупа̄де, Ягьясена прабху многие эти годы молил Господа о том, чтобы эти книги напечатались в типографии.
По милости Кр̣шн̣ы один московский преданный вдохновился напечатать книги "Истинный Гуру" и просил автора остаться инкогнито как спонсор.
В 2018 году они были напечатаны и распространены. В целях конспирации, автором по-прежнему был указан \"Прабхупа̄да дас\".

Сейчас во втором издании 2022 года по просьбе коллектива автор согласился указать свое имя:

 Ягьясена -- Прабхупа̄да дас

 -- коллектив подготовки 2-го издания

**Relevant quotes from |SP|’s teachings**
============================================================================

(From the book “THE FINAL ORDER”)

Does the Guru *have to be physically present* ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Physical*\ presence is **immaterial**; presence of the transcendental
sound received from the Spiritual Master should be the guidance of life.
That will make our spiritual life successful. If you feel very strongly
about my absence you may place my pictures on my sitting places and this
will be source of inspiration for you.

(S.P. Letter to Brahmananda and other students, 19/1/67)

But always remember that I am always with you. As you are always
thinking of me, I am always thinking of you also. Although
*physically*\ we are *not together*, we are not separated spiritually.
So we should be concerned **only**\ *\ *\ **with this spiritual
connection**.

(S.P. Letter to Gaurasundara, 13/11/69)

So we should associate by the vibration, and **not by the physical
presence**\ **.**\ That is **real**\ association.

(S.P. Lecture, 18/8/68, Montreal)

There are two conceptions of presence - the *physical*\ conception and
the vibrational conception. The *physical*\ conception is temporary,
whereas the vibrational conception is eternal [...] When we feel
separation from Krsna or the Spirirual Master, we should just try to
remember their words of instructions, and we will no longer feel that
separation. Such association with Krsna and the Spiritual Master should
be association by vibration **not physical presence**. That is *real*
association.

(Elevation To Krsna Consciousness, chapter 4)

Although according to material vision His Divine Grace Srila
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura Prabhupada passed away from this
material world on the last day of December 1936,1 still consider His
Divine Grace to be always present with me by His *vani,*\ His words.
There are two ways of association - by *vani*\ and by *vapu.
vani*\ means words and *vapu*\ means physical presence.
*Physical*\ presence is sometimes appreciable and sometimes not, but
*vani*\ continues to exist eternally. Therefore, one must take advantage
of the *vani*\ **,**\ **not the physical presence**.

(C.c. Antya, concluding words)

Therefore we should take advantage of the *vani*\ **,**\ **not the
physical presence**.

(S.P. Letter to Suci Devi dasi, 4/11/75)

**I shall remain your personal guidance**, *physically*\ present, or
**not physically**\ *,*\ as I am getting personal guidance from my Guru
Maharaja.

(S.P. Room conversation, 14/7/77, Vrindavan)

It is sometimes misunderstood that if one has to associate with persons
engaged in devotional service, he will not be able to solve the economic
problem. To answer this argument., it is described here that one has to
associate with liberated persons **not directly, physically**\ *,*\ but
by understanding, through philosophy and logic, the problems of life.

(S.B. 3.31.48, purport)

I am always with you. Never mind if I am **physically absent**. (S.P.
Letter to Jayananda, 16/9/67)

**Paramananda:**\ We're always feeling your presence very strongly,
|SP|, simply by your teachings and your instructions. We're
always meditating on your instructions.

**|SP|:**\ Thank you. That is the **real** presence.
**Physical presence is not import**

(S.P. Room conversation, 6/10/77, Vrindavan)

You write that you have desire to avail of my association again, but why
do you forget that you are always in association with me? When you are
helping my missionary activities I am always thinking of you, and you
are always thinking of me . That is real association. Just like I am
always thinking of my Guru Maharaja every moment, although He is not
*physically*\ present, and because I am trying to serve Him to my best
capacity, I am sure He is helping me by His spiritual blessings. So
there are two kinds of association: *physical*\ and preceptorial.
**Physical association is not so important as preceptorial
association**\ **.**

(S.P. Letter to Govinda dasi, 18/8/69)

As far as my blessing is concerned, it does **not require my physical
presence**\ *.*\ If you are chanting Hare Krsna there, and following my
instructions, reading the books, taking only Krsna prasadam etc., then
there is no question of your not receiving the blessings of Lord
Caitanya, whose mission I am humbly trying to push on.

(S.P. Letter to Bala Krsna, 30/6/74)

Anyone who has developed unflinching faith in the Lord and the Spiritual
Master can understand the revealed scripture unfold before him'. So
continue your present aptitude and you will be successful in your
spiritual progress. I am sure that even if I am **not physically
present** before you, still you will be able to execute **all spiritual
duties** in the matter of Krsna Consciousness, if you follow the above
principles.

(S.P. Letter to Subala, 29/9/67)

So although a *physical*\ body is not present, the vibration should be
accepted as the presence of the Spiritual Master, vibration. What we
have **heard** from the Spiritual Master, **that is living**\ **.**

(S.P. Lecture, 13/1/69, Los Angeles)

**Devotee:**...so sometimes the Spiritual Master is far away. He may be
in Los Angeles. Somebody is coming to Hamburg Temple. He thinks 'How
will the Spiritual Master be pleased?'

**|SP|:**\ Just follow his order, Spiritual Master is along
with you by his words. Just like my Spiritual Master is **not physically
present**\ **,**\ but I am associating with him by his words.

(S.P. Lecture, 18/8/71, London)

Just like I am working, so my Guru Maharaja is there, Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati\ **.**\ **Physically he may not be**, but in every action he
is there.

(S.P. Room conversation, 27/5/77, Vrindavan)

So that is called *prakata, physically*\ present. And there is another
phase, which is called *aprakata,*\ not physically present. But that
does not mean Krsna is dead or God is dead. That does not mean,
*prakata*\ or *aprakata,*\ **physically present or not present**, it
doesn't matter.

(S.P. Lecture 11/12/73, Los Angeles)

So, spiritually, there is no question of separation, *even
physically*\ we may be in far distant place.

(S.P. Letter to Syama dasi, 30/8/68)

I went to your country for spreading this information of Krsna
Consciousness and you are helping me in my mission, although I am **not
physically present** there but spiritually I am always with you.

(S.P. Letter to Nandarani, Krsna Devi and Subala, 3/10/67)

We are not separated actually. There are two - *vani*\ or *vapu -*\ So
*vapu*\ is *physical*\ presence and vara is presence by the vibration,
but they are all the same.

(S.P. Letter to Hansadutta, 22/6/70)

So in the absence of physical presentation of the spiritual master, the
*vaniseva*\ is more important. My Spiritual Master Sarasvati Gosvami
Thakura, may appear to be **physically not present**, but still because
I try to serve His instruction, I never feel separated from Him.

(Letter to Karandhara, 22/8/70)

I also do not feel separation from my Guru Maharaja. When I am engaged
in His service, His pictures give me sufficient strength. To serve
master's word is more important than to serve *Ыт physically.*

(Letter to Syamasundara, 19/7/70)

Follow the instruction, not the body
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So far as personal association with Guru is concerned, I was only with
my Guru Maharaj four or five times, but I have never left His
association, not even for a moment. Because I am following His
instruction, I have never felt any separation. There are some of my
Godbrothers here in India, who had constant personal association with
Guru Maharaja, but who are neglecting His orders. This is just like the
bug who is sitting on the lap of the king. He may be very puffed up by
his position but all he can succeed in doing is biting the king.
Personal association is not so important as association through service.

(S.P. Letter to Satyadhana, 20/2/72)

So spiritually, appearance and disappearance, there is no difference
[...] spiritually there is no such difference, appearance or
disappearance. So although this is the disappearance day of Om Visnupada
Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, so there is nothing to be
lamented, although we feel separation.

(S.P. Lecture, 13/12/73, Los Angeles)

So my Guru Maharaja will be very, very much pleased upon you [...] it is
not that He is dead and gone. That is not spiritual understanding [...]
He is seeing. I never feel that I am alone.

(S.P. Lecture, 2/3/75)

**vani**\ **is more important than**\ **vapu.**\ (S.P. Letter to
TustaKrsna, 14/12/72)

Yes I am glad that your centre is doing so well and all the devotees are
now appreciating the presence of their Spiritual Master by following his
instructions, although he is no longer physically present. This is the
right spirit.

(S.P. Letter to Karandhara, 13/9/70)

The spiritual master by **his words**, can penetrate into the heart of
the suffering person and inject knowledge transcendental which **alone**
can extinguish the fire of material existence.

(S.B. 1.7.22, purport)

There are two words, *vani*\ and *vapu. vani*\ means words, and
*vapu*\ means the physical body, *vapu*\ will be finished. This material
body it will be finished, that is the nature. But if we keep to the
*vani,*\ to the words of the spiritual master, then we remain very fixed
up...if you always keep intact, in link with the words and instructions
of the higher instructions, then you are always fresh. This is spiritual
understanding.

(S.P. Lecture, 2/3/75)

Never think that I am absent from you. Physical presence is not
essential; presence by message (or hearing) is the real touch.

(S.P. Letter to students, 2/8/67)

Reception of spiritual knowledge is never checked by any material
condition. (S.B. 7.7.1,purport)

The potency of transcendental sound is never minimised because the
vibrator is apparently absent.

(S.B. 2.9.8, purport)

The disciple and Spiritual Master are never separated because the
Spiritual Master always keeps company with the disciple as long as the
disciple follows strictly the instructions of the Spiritual Master. This
is called the association of *vani. Physical*\ presence is called
*vapu.*\ As long as the Spiritual Master is *physically*\ present, the
disciple should serve the *physical*\ body of the Spiritual Master, and
when the Spiritual Master is no longer *physically*\ existing, the
disciple should serve the instructions of the Spiritual Master.

(S.B. 4.28.47, purport)

If there is no chance to serve the Spiritual Master directly, a devotee
should serve him by remembering his instructions. There is no difference
between the Spiritual Master's instructions and the Spiritual Master
himself. In his absence therefore, his words of direction should be
pride of the disciple.

(C.c. Adi 1.35, purport)

He lives forever by his divine instructions, and the follower lives with
him. (S.B. Preface)

He reasons ill who tells that *Vaisnavas*\ die, when thou art still
living in sound. (Bhaktivinoda Thakura)

Yes, the ecstacy of separation of Spiritual Master is even greater
ecstasy than meeting with him.

(S.P. Letter to Jadurani, 13/1/68)

Krsna and his representative is the same. Just like Krsna can be present
simultaneously in million of places. Similarly, the Spiritual Master
also can be present wherever the disciple wants. **A Spiritual Master is
the principle, not the body**\ **.** Just like a television can be seen
in thousands of place by the principle of relay monitoring.

(S.P. Letter to Malati, 28/5/68)

It.is better service to Krsna and Spiritual Master in a feeling of
separation; sometimes there is a risk in the matter of direct service.

(S.P. Letter to Madhusudana, 30/12/67)

The Books are enough
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Devotee: **\ |SP| **when you're not present with us**, how
is it possible to receive instructions? For example in questions that
may arise... **|SP|:**\ Well the questions are
answ...answers are there in my books.

(S.P. Morning walk, 13/5/73, Los Angeles)

So utilise whatever time you find to make a thorough study of **my
books**. Then all your questions will be answered.

(S.P. Letter to Upendra, 7/1/76)

If it is possible to go to the temple, then take advantage of the
temple. A temple is a place where by one is given the opportunity to
render direct devotional service to the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna. In
conjunction with this you should always read my books daily and all your
questions will be answered and you will have a firm basis of Krsna
Consciousness. In this way your life will be perfect.

(SP Letter to Hugo Salemon, 22/11/74)

Every one of you must regularly read our books at least twice, in the
morning and evening, and **automatically all questions** will be
answered.

(SP Letter to Ranadhir, 24/1/70)

In my books the philosophy of Krsna Consciousness is explained
**fully**\ so if there is anything which you do not understand, then you
simply have to read again and again. By reading daily **the knowledge
will be**\ *\ *\ **revealed**\ *\ *\ **to you** and by this process your
spiritual life will develop.

(SP Letter to Bahurupa, 22/11/74)

**|SP|:**\ Even a moments association with a pure devotee -
all success!

**Revatinanda:**\ Does that also apply to reading the words of a pure
devotee?

**|SP|:**\ Yes

**Revatinanda:**\ Even a little association with your books has the same
effect?

**|SP|:**\ Effect. Of course it requires both things. One
must be very eager to take it.

(S.P. Room conversation, 13/12/70, Indore)

After 80 years, no one can be expected to live long. My life is almost
ended. So you have to carry on, and **these books will
do**\ *\ *\ **everything**\ *.*

(S.P. Room conversation, 18/2/76)

**Paramahamsa:**\ My question is: a pure devotee, when he comments on
Bhagavad-gītā, someone who never sees him physically, but he just comes
in contact with the commentary, explanation, is this the same thing?

**|SP|:**\ Yes. You can associate with Krsna by reading
Bhagavad-gītā. And these saintly persons, they have given their
explanations, comments. So where is the difficulty?

(S.P. Morning walk, 11/6/74, Paris)

There is **nothing new** to be said. **Whatever I had to say. I
have**\ *\ *\ **already**\ *\ *\ **said in mv books**. Now you must try
to understand it and continue your endeavours. Whether I am present or
not does not matter.

(S.P. Room conversation, 17/5/77, Vrindavan)

If I depart there is no cause for lamentation. I will always be with you
through my books and orders. I will always remain with you in that way.

(BTG 13.1-2, December 1977)

|SP| is our Eternal Guru
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Reporter:**\ What will happen to the Movement in the United States
when you die?

**|SP|:**\ I will never die!

**Devotees:**\ Jaya! Haribol! *(laughter)*\ **|SP|:**\ I
will live from my books and **you will utilise**\ **.**

(S.P. Interview, 17/5/75, Berkley)

**Indian Lady:**...is that spiritual master still guiding after the
death?

**|SP|:**\ Yes, yes. Just like Krsna is guiding us,
similarly spiritual master will guide.

(SP Lecture, 23/9/69)

The eternal bond between disciple and Spiritual Master begins from the
first day he **hears**.

(S.P. Letter to Jadurani, 4/9/72)

The influence of a pure devotee is such that if someone comes to
associate with him with a little faith, one gets the chance of
**hearing** about the Lord **from authoritative scriptures** like
Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad Bhāgavatam [...] This is the first stage of
association with pure devotees.

(Nectar of Devotion, chapter 19)

These are not ordinary books. It is recorded chanting. **Anyone who
reads, he is hearing**.

(S.P. Letter to Rupanuga, 19/10/74)

Regarding *parampara*\ system, there is nothing to wonder for big gaps
[...] We have to pick up the
**prominent**\ *\ *\ **acaryas**\ *\ *\ **and follow from him**.

(S.P. Letter to Dayananda, 12/4/68)

These great souls(members of the disciplic succession) were not mere
luminaries like comets appearing in the firmament for a while and
disappearing as soon as their mission is done. They are like so many
suns shining all along to give light and heat to succeeding generations.
Long time yet to roll on when they will be succeeded by others of
sublime mind, beauty and calibre.

(Bhaktivinoda Thakura)

**Narayana:**\ So those disciples who don't have the opportunity to see
you or speak with you..

**|SP|:**\ That he was speaking, *vani*\ and *vapu.*\ **Even
if you don't see his body, you take his
words,**\ *\ *\ **vani**\ *\ *\ **.**

**Narayana:**\ But how do they know they're pleasing you?

**|SP|:**\ If you actually follow the words of Guru, that
means he is pleased. And if you do not follow, how can he be pleased?

**Sudama:**\ Not only that, but your mercy is spread everywhere, and if
we take advantage, you told us once, then we will feel the result.

**|SP|:**\ Yes.

**Jayadvaita:**\ And if we have faith in what the Guru says, then
automatically we'll do that.

**|SP|:**\ Yes. My Guru Maharaja passed away in 1936, and I
started this Movement in 1965, thirty years after. Then? I am getting
the mercy of Guru. This is *vani.*\ **Even if Guru is not physically
present, if you follow the**\ *\ *\ **vani.**\ *\ *\ **then you are
getting help.**

**Sudama:**\ So there is no question of ever separation as long as the
disciple follows the instructions of Guru.

**|SP|:**\ No. *cakhu dano dilojei.*\ What is that, next
one?

**Sudama:**\ *cakhu dano dilojei, janmejanme prabhu sei.*

**|SP|:**\ *Janme janme prabhu sei.*\ So where there is
separation\ **?**\ **Who has opened your eves, he is birth after birth
your**\ *\ *\ **prabhu**\ *\ *\ **.**

(S.P. Morning walk, 21/7/75, San Francico)

**Madhudvisa:**\ Is there any way for a Christian to, without the help
of a Spiritual Master, to reach the spiritual sky through believing the
words of Jesus Christ and trying to follow his teachings?

**|SP|:**\ I don't follow.

**Tamal Krsna Gosvami:**\ Can a Christian in this age, without a
Spiritual Master, but by reading the

Bible, and following Jesus's words, reach the ...

**|SP|:**\ When you read the Bible, you follow Spiritual
Master. How can you say without. As soon as you read the Bible, that
means you are following the instruction of Lord Jesus Christ, that means
that you are following Spiritual Master. So where is the opportunity of
being without Spiritual Master.

**Madhudvisa:**\ **I was referring to a living Spiritual Master**.

**|SP|:**\ **Spiritual Master is not question of...
Spiritual Master is eternal. Spiritual**\ *\ *\ **Master is
eternal**...so your question is 'without Spiritual Master'. Without
Spiritual Master you cannot be at any stage of your life. You may accept
this Spiritual Master or that Spiritual Master. That is a different
thing. But you have to accept. As you say that "by reading
Bible\ **",**\ **when you**\ *\ *\ **read Bible that means vou are
following the Spiritual Master represented**\ *\ *\ **by some priest or
some clergyman in the line of Lord Jesus Christ**.

(S.P. Morning walk, 2/10/68, Seattle)

You have asked if it is true that the spiritual master remains in the
universe until all his disciples are transferred to the spiritual sky.
The answer is yes, this is the rule.

(S.P. Letter to Jayapataka, 11/7/69)
